The warden Colonel Grat explains the misunderstandings , explaining that they are in war against the Suliban terrorist organization Cabal , and that the inmates are pacific Sulibans relocated temporarily for their own safety . He claims that he has no authority to release the earthlings and they should be sent to the central magistrate office in Tander Pride as a simple bureaucratic formality . However , Captain Archer discloses that the interns are hold imprisoned due to prejudice against their race and resolves to interfere in the fate of the Sulibans . "" Detained "" is a reasonable episode with a story based on the prejudice of Americans against Japanese people that lived in USA after Pearl Harbor attack . I do not know whether the interference of Captain Archer and his unusual alliance with the Sulibans will have consequences in the future . Title ( Brazil ) : "" Detidos "" ( "" Detained "" )","There are few fence-riders where this movie is concerned . Most fans of the genre of Horror and of the sub-genre of WereWolf movies either love this movie . . . or hate it . Let me begin by saying that I admire this movie very much . I enjoy watching it , and the two subsequent sequels . In my opinion , after the third Howling , they got stupid , hokey , campy , and just plain bad . Also , let me warn you that this movie is dated , slow , and has large blocks of uneventful moments where even the most base character development is not being utilized . But , with that having been said , the story is a good story . It is poorly executed due to the large slow spots I mentioned before , but the story was a sound and well-written one . Everything does not just magically come together . The reporting team there as moral and emotional support for ace reporter , Karen White ( Dee Wallace ) , is working very hard to put it together . Their discoveries do not come easy , but rather as a result of hard work , open-mindedness , and diligence . Not luck . The cinematography is mostly unremarkable , except for the scene in which Bill is attacked . The filmography is beautiful there , with the moonlight streaming out from behind two great trees , and the scene between is clear and lit by a beautifully brilliant silvery moonlight . Very good stuff . I also loved the use of The Wolf Man , 1941 with Lon Chaney , Jr . as a source for information in their research . This is an instance in which a movie used a real movie to quote , rather than some made-up movie . Wes Craven's use of this element was highly praised in the Scream Trilogy , and yet , here it is , twenty years earlier . This production also features a cameo by Forrest J . Ackerman , movie actor with credits in over 20 B-grade horror flicks , and a very good ( if somewhat over the top ) supporting performance by John Carradine . Naturally , most fans of the horror genre want to compare this movie to An American Werewolf in London . That is , of course , like comparing apples to submarines in that the former is a B production , with a small budget and the latter is a much larger funded project at exactly TEN times the budget . The Howling had a 17M return from a 1M investment , while AWiL had a 30 . 5M return from a 10M budget . Let's see . . . 17X the investment / 3 . 5X the investment . I'd have to say "" The Howling "" is the big winner , here , as far as profit goes . I use profit as a measuring stick , because it seems that profit is all Hollywood cares about anymore . Art and artistic expression no longer seems to be the point of film making these days . But for the sake of art , I loved both movies , this one and its competitor . The make up artistry used here was excellent , and actually worthy of the story . That , along with truly professional performances by Dee Wallace and Christopher Stone , make this an enjoyable and memorable film , which I have recently added to my DVD collection . All in all , I consider "" The Howling "" to be a benchmark film in the sub-genre of werewolf movies . It rates a hard-won from . . . the Fiend : .",2488512,2626332,False
1,"An excellent hidden gem from writer / director Luis Estrada that won over 20 awards . The Mayor of San Pedro loses his head while trying to abscond with the town's money , so the party puts in a figurehead ( Damián , - Crónicas , The Crime of Father Amaro ) until the elections . Soon , he figures out the way of politics and is enjoying the benefits - and they are hot benefits ! Soon , he is killing his enemies and extorting money like the rest of them . Of course , he manages to rise through his evil as all politicians do .

This five-time Oscar nominated film , with a win for sound , was one of the best pictures of 1947 , the year that brought us Miracle on 34th Street , and the Oscar winning Gentlemen's Agreement . Certainly a great year for films that make us think about what is important . The Bishop , the great David Niven , really doesn't know what he wants . He is trapped in dreams of glory , and has forgotten those around him that need his love and attention . he prays for guidance . Cary Grant , who makes a perfect angel , shows up and helps him understand what the important things in life are and transforms him . He reconnects him to his wife , the beautiful Loretta Young , who won an Oscar the same year for The Farmer's Daughter . The angel , of course , helps many others along the way before he leaves .

If Dan didn't lose it already in the horrors he faced and participated in Afghanistan he lost it now here in jolly old England ! It's then that Dan starts to get a little crazy in not knowing exactly what to do to suppress his uncontrollable anger . Dan soon decides to clean up the town of crime to make him forget the crime committed on him ; By his old lady in dumping Dan at a time , with him suffering from post traumatic stress , that he needed her most . Dan recruits a number of people who've gotten a raw deal from both the criminals , who victimized them , and courts , who let their victimizers off Scot-free . It's with these people that Dan creates an outfit that goes after both the criminal element of London and the corrupt politicians police and judges who let them off . The anti-crime outfit coined by the London Media as the Outlaws that Dan's in charge of wakes havoc on the crime syndicate running London and it's untouchable , from the law , Godfather Manning , Rob Fry . One of the members of Dan's team is barrister Cedric Munroe , Lennie James , who was prosecuting Manning and had his wife and unborn child murdered by Mannings hoods . Dan also had Munroe's personal chafferer retired London policeman Walter Lewis , Bo Hoskins , join his team of crime fighters . It's Lewis who provided Dan with important information to who's in the pay , and is paying off , those in the justice system to keep Manning from ending up behind bars . Dan at first gets the job done in cleaning up the streets of London of the criminal scum who's been given a free ride by politicians like , he's in fact mentioned a number of times in the film , the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair ! What Blair had exactly to do with the likes of hoodlums like Manning is never quite explained in the movie ? It's later that Dan's dirty half dozen , the number of persons including himself in his hit squad , start to really screw things up ! with Dan himself doing more then his share of screwing ! SPOILER ALERT The movie "" Outlaw "" moves to its inevitable conclusion with what's left of Dan's crime fighters somehow , it's really left up in the air by the films writers and director , being double crossed by one of their own . There's a wild shootout outside of London around Manning's secret hideout with almost everyone of the Outlaws getting plugged by the cops . Yes it was non other then the London Police themselves who came to Mannings rescue ! These so-called law enforcement agents , the police , were so trigger happy and unprofessional that they even shot down one of the Outlaws when he dropped his weapons and willingly surrendered ! A gross and major violation of the Geneava Accords of 1929 ! Something that the Nazis were convicted of doing at the Nuremburg Trials back in 1946 ! But all was not lost with the Outlaws , or one or two of them , coming back to exact justice . The justice that was denied to one of those major criminals whom the corrupt British Justice System wantonly allowed to escape .","' Sing , Babies , Sing ' is one of a series of shorts produced by the Fleischer studio which followed an interesting format : some typical Fleischer black-and-white animation ( cartoon gags with a musical soundtrack ) would book-end a live-action musical performance by some popular vaudeville act of the time . Generally , the title of the short was also the title of the tune sung by the performer . This one has better cartoon gags than most of the series . We're in some sort of baby factory , where the stork prepares the babies for delivery . We see a cartoon version of Eddie Cantor doing his duck-quack routine ( from ' Palmy Days ' ) and a cartoon version of Ed Wynn wearing a fireman's helmet and driving a fire engine : this is a reference to Wynn's popular radio show , sponsored by Texaco , which cast him as ' The Texaco Fire Chief ' . There's also an astonishing gag , featuring a Jewish baby ( with a big nose ) singing ' Shuffle Off to Buffalo ' with new lyrics . The middle sequence is a live-action performance by Baby Rose Marie , a hugely popular child performer from radio and vaudeville of this period . At this point , she was about ten years old , but performed in baby-doll dresses that made her look younger . Her remarkable singing voice resembles the tones of a grown woman ! Nowadays , the considerably older Rose Marie is best known for her adult performance on ' The Dick Van Dyke Show ' . Fans of her adult performances will be fascinated to catch a glimpse of her here , from her child stardom . Apparently there was some sort of legal problem with the live-action sequences in Fleischer's series : on several occasions in recent years , these shorts have resurfaced with the live-action sequences chopped out ; the cartoon builds up to the entrance of a performer who never arrives ! This is a real shame , as the performers in Fleischers series often did very little other film work , so their performances here are of historical value . ' Sing , Babies , Sing ' is one of the few pieces of film footage of Rose Marie from her years as a child star . I'll rate this short .",2721657,1609079,False
3,"In terms of humor or songs , I can't honestly rank this was high as most of the other Muppet films BUT it may be the most touching version of the Dickens classic story I've ever seen on film . The lyrics to the last two songs are fantastic : very Christian-like and very profound . Scrooge ( Michael Caine ) , meanwhile , is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions . His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring , generous person is done more subtly , too , than in other films . However , to be fair , sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story . The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing . Not much offensive in here , either , making this a good film for little ones as well as older , sentimental folks .","It's nice to see World War II films making a comeback , as they have seemed to do since the arrival of "" Saving Private Ryan "" in 1997 . This is another of them and with modern technology the viewers get to experience some very realistic action scenes . The main thing is that the story is interesting . With a John Woo-directed film , you know are going to get tons of action , almost always too much , and that's the case here . However , some of the scenes are fantastic . You also get some beautiful cinematography . Still on the positive , the acting was good in here with Nicholas Cage in the lead role and a lesser-name-but-good supporting cast . The story , although fairly long at 134 minutes , was never boring . On the negative side , as mentioned , Woo tends to overkill and this movie must have a set record for number of people killed . It also leans on the politically correct side , of course , with Native American spirituality given complete reverence as usual and the Catholic ( Cage ) looking like a very weak in his beliefs . In modern-days , you'll never see the opposite shown on film . Anyway , it's a good action movie that certainly entertains . The intense and long action makes it almost too much to watch in one viewing !",4445210,4445210,True
4,"The movie that made director Alan Parker really famous tells the true - if somewhat exaggerated - story of Billy Hayes ( Brad Davis ) , who got thrown into a hellish Turkish prison after he was caught smuggling hashish . The movie starts off by setting up the historical context . The first thing that you see is Billy and his hubby Susan ( Irene Miracle ) reading about Janis Joplin's death in the paper . But once he gets arrested , then things get ugly . You'll need a strong stomach to watch this movie . That of course means that they did really well with it in every way . Oliver Stone was one of the screenwriters . Also starring Randy Quaid , John Hurt , and Bo Hopkins .","This film has been available on DVD for a couple of years but I've resisted buying it having seen it on TV several years ago and aware that ' message ' movies seldom stand up in later years . Actually I was pleasantly surprised although I do agree with several of the points made by other posters here ; yes , there is a lack of chemistry between Gregory Peck and Dorothy McGuire and yes , he would have done much better to opt for Celeste Holm ( whose Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well deserved ) and yes it was asking a lot to make us believe that Albert Dekker would have been unaware of employment policies in his own organization etc . I have always found Peck a highly watchable and vastly underrated actor who , in common with Jack Lemmon , exudes decency from every pore so that it is hardly coincidence that he has in his screen personas fought racism against Jews and Blacks . John Garfield for once playing a decent person is strangely muted ; Garfield came out of the Group Theatre and embodies the virility and raw passion of that outfit lots of it provided by Clifford Odets and he would have been more effective opposing Peck rather than supporting him . On the other hand the film was made in 1947 and did , for the time , take an unpopular stance . Gadge himself emerged from the Group and had already directed Pinky , another of Fox's moral statements and he was reunited with Garfield as Garfield was reunited with Ann Revere who had played his mother in Body and Soul that same year . In mentioning these names I have perhaps put my finger on one of the problems with this movie ; it is , by any stretch of the imagination , a great cast yet comprises conflicting styles from McGuire's ' soft ' feminine image to Holm's brittle , wisecracking stylist to Garfield's raw virility to Peck's basically decent nice guy . Somehow the whole is greater than the parts and it remains very watchable .",4888011,2567136,False

6,"CAPOTE is a great movie . Let that be said at the beginning of this review . The superb screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke in turn based on that part of the life of Truman Capote when he was obsessed with writing his final and finest novel ' In Cold Blood ' , and the extraordinary directing by Bennett Miller who influenced a fine production crew and coaxed brilliant performances from his cast is all a well established fact . That all of this could be brought together in the featurettes that accompany the film on the DVD release is an example of just how fine additive commentaries can be . This is not only a superb film ; it is also an equally superb DVD package . Philip Seymour Hoffman as the idiosyncratic author Truman Capote probes the psyche of this strange but gifted writer from his first newspaper clipping of the November 15 , 1959 brutal murders of the Clutter family in Holbrook through his immersion in the tiny Kansas town accompanied by his friend and fellow writer Harper Lee ( Catherine Keener ) absorbing the atmosphere where such a deed could happen , ingratiating himself with investigator Alvin Dewey ( Chris Cooper ) and his wife Marie ( Amy Ryan ) to gain access to information that will eventually result in material for his projected book . He becomes obsessed with the murderers Perry Smith ( Clifton Collins , Jr . ) and Richard Hickock ( Mark Pellegrino ) , connecting with Smith in particular on a very basic level and providing the men with lawyers to appeal their conviction for a long enough time to eventually hear the truth of the night of grisly mayhem that fascinates Capote so . The story ends with the execution of Smith and Hickock in 1965 , an occasion that further bewilders the now fragile mind of Capote as he gains the end to his story while simultaneously watching the loved Smith dangle from the scaffold in death . Each actor is exceptional here : Hoffman does indeed deserve his Oscar for a brilliant portrayal . But it is the aftermath that brings even more poignancy to the film . Hearing Bennett , Clarke , and Futterman discuss the origin of the cinematic idea blends naturally with the production crews ' commentary about the choice of Winnipeg , Canada as the location to depict Kansas , the thorough preparation of the design and costuming and color palette and camera techniques , and then the comments by four of the main actors ( Hoffman , Keener , Cooper , and Collins ) illuminate not only the characters they depicted in the film but also the dynamics of entering into this strange world of bleak winter murder . The effect of the featurettes is staggering and makes the viewer want to immediately replay the entire movie . This DVD package should serve as the template for future releases : the disc in its entirety is an art form that has few peers . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp","Dynasty Reunion : Catfights and Caviar  was a fun reunion with some members of the cast : Linda Evans , Joan Collins , Al Corley , Pamela Bellwood , Gordon Thompson , Catherine Oxenberg , Emma Samms , and finally , John Forsythe . "" Dynasty "" was a fun , over the top show , and the cast seemed to really enjoy their reminisces . They also seemed to have a genuine fondness for one another , which was nice to see . A couple of things one wonders about , not the least of which is why ABC didn't air this show since Dynasty was an ABC staple for 11 years . The second thing is , why does Linda Evans look as she does ? One would think these actors could afford the very best surgery , yet Evans and Al Corley , once a beautiful man , looked beyond dreadful . I wouldn't want to see Joan Collins when she wakes up in the morning , but boy , can she still pull it off - and she's a good deal older than 61-year-old Evans . John Forsythe came on only at the end , which someone questioned - the man is 88 years old . God bless him , he seems in good health and in possession of his faculties - two things to be cherished . But I doubt he had the stamina to do an entire taping . It's a pity and not understandable why John James refused to be on the show or have clips of him shown . There was a talk show some years ago on which Linda Evans and a couple of other Dynasty people appeared and James was involved then . Wonder what happened . It was great to see the Moldavia Massacre , all the catfights , Krystle's double , and the clothes . I still remember a blue gown slit up the front that Linda Evans wore . She and a few other ladies in the ' 80s made being in your forties very fashionable .

Other creatures such as an alien , zombies , and Frankenstein's monster never get their full due because director Hickox can not slow the movie down enough to provide us with any kind of substance to hold a hat on . I swear this film is held together by plywood and string . Poor Patrick Macnee must do with a character called Sir Wilfred who has been planning an attack on Lincoln for sometime . The film is episodic showing what each character faces as they enter ( . . or are thrown into ) each exhibit . There's plenty of gore and the lovely Deborah Foreman is probably enough to give this film a go . Obviously lovers of the classic Universal horrors might find some worth in this drivel , but I have a feeling they will find the make-up work of these creatures as laughable to the point of disrespect .

Granger's a semi-public figure , he's a tennis pro , but not an especially high one . High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman . So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon , Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them , complete strangers , did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise . Though Granger is repulsed by the idea , one of the beautiful things about this film , is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptation . In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot , Granger's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man , he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walker's father so that Walker can inherit his estate . Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that . Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role , ironically in his last complete film . Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished . Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either . Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him , the tension . Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing , first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene . And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger . Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best , it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing .","Don't see this if there are no subtitles and your French is sketchy at best to non-existent otherwise you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure out if it's a fantasy or what . It's 1917 and the war is in full spate . In the North East of the country Sylvie Testud gets a Dear Jean letter and instead of murmuring philosophically , c'est la vie , c'est l'amour she chops off her hair , finds a pair of pants and lights out for the front to ask the guy who done her wrong just what he thinks he's doing . Before long she runs across a raggle-taggle unit led by Pascal Greggory , tags along and winds up with a uniform - they just happened to have a spare in her size as you do - but no gun and becomes part of the group . They march , and march and march some more but strangely enough in the middle of a major war they never run into any actual fighting though they do hear gunfire on one occasion . Even more bizarrely they keep breaking into song , complete with an quintet / sextet of soldier / musicians at a time when one would have thought discretion would dictate silence . Eventually Testud's errant mate shows up , they put in some sack time - in pajamas yet , presumably from the same quartermaster's stores that laid the uniform on Testud - and the group moves on leaving them to it . It's actually a beautifully shot and engrossing film a sort of hybrid of Yentl , Victor Victoria and A Very Long Engagement . Sylvie Testud is clearly brave enough to play a role in which she is seen as androgynous whereas she is actually a very lovely and very feminine actress and she works well with Greggory although virtually all the actors turn in fine performances . Not really multiplex fodder but no worse for that so if there's an Art House near you lobby them to book this .",2483625,2567136,False
9,"Ghosts On The Loose  has one of the more interesting casts in film , with members of the East Side Kids top billed with Bela Lugosi and aspiring newcomer Ava Gardner . However as strong as the lineup looks on paper , the movie itself is a rather hum drum affair , with a few funny gags and one liners thrown in as Leo Gorcey leads the way . Those who tune in due to Lugosi's presence may be disappointed . His on screen time is actually very minimal , and is mostly spent disparaging his band of Nazi agents . A characteristic line - "" Why do I have such idiots around me ? "" Gardner's role is that of Glimpy's ( Huntz Hall ) sister , planning her wedding to Jack Gibson ( Rick Vallin ) . Similar to Lugosi , her role is almost a throw away with not much to do . As a newlywed , she doesn't seem too upset by an interrupted honeymoon , while husband Jack is even less believable chasing down the printing press responsible for Nazi propaganda . The best bits are reserved for the East Siders . Glimpy's wedding tux was borrowed from a mortuary , due back the next day for the funeral of a mobster . Sunshine Sammy Morrison as Scruno is a welcome addition to the gang's antics , while Mugs delivers his share of fractured one liners . One of my favorites - "" Well can you picture that , I must be havin ' optical delusions "" . "" Ghosts On The Loose "" helps reinforce for me that the East Side / Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys did their best work in support of a major star , case in point - "" Angels With Dirty Faces "" .

Collins used to be mixed up with Thorne's gang , and that's what wound him up in the State Penitentiary . Thorne's plan is to spring him legitimately , and set him up in the telegraph office to intercept the time that a big payday will come through town .

10,"After hearing so much about "" Blue Velvet "" I was very disappointed . Sitting down to watch it , I knew it would be a bizarre experience and had heard that it was quite disturbing ; however , I have a strong stomach . What I don't like about "" Blue Velvet "" is that it seems like exploitation . It didn't "" disturb "" me but I didn't enjoy it , feel comfortable watching it , and was appalled by Lynch's directorial decisions . The scene in which Dennis Hopper uses his oxygen mask goes on too long , and is too explicit and sick and depraved . Frankly , I don't care if this is a "" satire "" of our world . I've read that it's supposed to be an examination of the evil that lurks beneath suburban America . That it's all a dream in the protagonist's head . Etc . However , in order to stress this , Lynch did not need to resort to some of the over-the-top , excessive elements that he used .

15,"I briefly worked for the Reuters news agency ( in a very minor capacity ) during the Cold War , so I was curious to see the film ' This Man Reuter ' , which purports to be a biopic of Paul Julius Reuter . I knew almost nothing about the agency's founder before I saw this film . . . and now that I've seen it , I still know almost nothing about him . How much of this movie is true ? I get the impression that very little of it is . The good news first : this is an extremely well-made Warner Brothers ' prestige ' picture , expertly directed by the great William Dieterle and splendidly photographed by the legendary James Wong Howe . There are some fine montage sequences ( by Don Siegel ? ) , easily up to this studio's standard . ( Warners always had the best montages . ) There's a good supporting cast , and Edward G Robinson gives conviction and humanity to the leading role . I was even pleased to see a brief appearance by former silent-film comedian George Ovey . The bad news : in spite of all of the above , I still find myself wondering how much of this actually happened . We see Reuter ( Robinson ) in the mid-19th century , as a man obsessed with acquiring information and disseminating it as rapidly as possible . He begins by using a telegraph and carrier pigeons to collect the stock-market quotations , selling the information to a cartel of brokers . ( Ovey appears during this pigeon sequence . ) There's an amusing scene with Gene Lockhart as a broker who schemes to get one jump ahead of his rivals , and is promptly outsmarted by Robinson . Lockhart was one of those character actors whom audiences liked to see humiliated and outsmarted . ( Another such was Walter Catlett . ) Lockhart is in good form here , but I suspect that he's portraying a fictional character . Another fictional character here , surely , is the hero's buddy Max , portrayed by Eddie Albert . I've always liked Albert and regretted that he never really clicked in films : he was typecast as the hero's earnest pal , and hardly got a chance to transcend that niche : he certainly doesn't transcend it here . I suspect that Jack Warner inserted the handsome Albert into this film as an attraction for female movie-goers who mightn't want to look at Edward G Robinson . SPOILERS COMING NOW . Inevitably , Reuter's empire prospers . . . and here comes a climax which I well and truly suspect is Hollywood fiction . It's now April 1865 , and there's still no transatlantic telegraph cable to replace the one that broke in 1858 . With the Civil War raging in the U . S . A . , Reuter has a rival in London who's receiving transatlantic despatches faster than Reuter can get them . Reuter comes up with a Heath Robinson system to shave a few minutes off his rival's time , by dropping messages overboard as ships reach the Irish coast , trusting them to wash ashore and be retrieved , then cabling the gen to London . Will Reuter's method work ? Astoundingly , the very FIRST message that Reuter receives by this method is the assassination of Lincoln . ( Which we see in one of the montages . ) Is this true ? Was the news of Lincoln's assassination indeed Reuter's first transatlantic despatch . . . or merely his first major scoop ? ( Another big scoop - - the end of America's Civil War - - occurred only a few days before Lincoln's assassination , yet we get no mention of that here . ) ' This Man Reuter ' is a very enjoyable film , of the sort they don't make any more , but it has a strong aroma of Hollywood hokum rather than fact . I wish I knew how much of this movie was accurate . Purely for its entertainment value , I'll rate it .","I viewed a print of this short movie courtesy of Lobster Films , Paris . Here we have a French ' trick ' film by the Pathe Brothers , from the same period in which Georges Melies was making his very popular trick movies . However , in Melies's films the trickery was accomplished by jump cuts , and spectacle was provided by elaborate sets and audacious story lines . In ' The Kiriki , Japanese Acrobats ' , we have a fairly straightforward acrobatic performance , abetted by some trickery that is far simpler than Melies's box of tricks , yet no less satisfying . We see some men , women and children in gymnastic clothing , clearly Caucasian yet made up to look vaguely Oriental , with ridiculously built-up foreheads covered by ludicrous hairstyles . The women creep back and forth in that ridiculous shuffling gait ( move the feet very quickly but in very tiny steps ) that western performers affect to simulate Orientals . I realise that , in the first decade of the twentieth century , the most proficient acrobatic troupes were nearly all Japanese . . . but frankly , this ying-tong Japanoiserie did absolutely nothing to add to the proceedings , and should have been dispensed with . In small groups , the troupe rapidly execute a series of acrobatic manoeuvres which are so dazzling that they seem nearly superhuman . There is , of course , a trick : a deceptively simple one , yet done so skilfully that some viewers may have difficulty figuring it out . TRICK EXPLAINED NOW . Except for some ' book-end ' footage at the beginning and the end , which is shot conventionally , the entire movie is filmed with an overhead camera shooting STRAIGHT DOWN onto a black velvet dropcloth surrounded by four upright walls . The actors , lying on this surface , affect postures to indicate that they are standing upright , with one of the walls being treated as a horizontal floor . When the tumblers move ' upwards ' , supposedly defying gravity , they are in fact merely moving horizontally , away from the wall representing the ' floor ' and towards the opposite wall representing the ' ceiling ' . The lighting , from directly above , eliminates side shadows and makes the trickery less obvious . The trick is made more difficult to spot because the stunts are done quickly and proficiently , and the performers demonstrate some genuine agility . To call this a ' trick ' film is slightly demeaning to their efforts , since there is some genuine acrobatic work going on here : just not in the direction that it seems to be . I was amused and impressed by this movie , but I would have enjoyed it far more without the utterly unnecessary racial stereotyping . My rating for this one : .",1609079,1609079,True

It's the second of three Presley titles with a racing milieu , though this element isn't as much to the fore here as in the others ; conveniently , he doubles as a swooning singer / guitarist with a band – and most of the running-time sees him dodging a couple of marriage proposals from eminent figures in the community ! It transpires that even the tomboyish female drummer in his outfit secretly pines for him . . . but , given the film's jejeune nature , everything is neatly sorted out by the end – as a writer researching The Perfect Male eventually hitches up with Presley's proposed racing employer ( played by a U .

I really wanted to like this film because the central idea ( a woman with a guilty past fears for her life in an institution ) and some of the imagery ( especially the green mask motif ) were intriguing enough . Unfortunately , the plot development was extremely muddled - with new characters introduced from time to time but subsequently given little to do ( chief among them Angelo Rossitto as Lugosi's deaf-and-dumb but , by the latter's own admission , bad-tempered dwarfish sidekick ) . Besides , it establishes situations - for instance , Lugosi's long-time grudge with George Zucco - that are ultimately left hanging in the air and which it never bothers to resolve or adequately explain , that one's attention is bound to wander throughout . Add to this the inane comic relief provided by Nat Pendelton as a dumb cop ( who is even less appetizingly involved in a romance with the household's ordinary and inevitably frightened maid ) and Douglas Fowley as a flustered reporter ( who has no purpose in being there at all but has a ditzy blonde in tow for good measure ) and it comes as no surprise that the end result is so flat and poorly done in all departments ! !

Palpatine's face was disfigured during his battle with Mace Windu in order to make it match the wizened old troll we knew only as "" the Emperor "" in 4 , 5 , & 6 . Princess Leia , when remembering her mother in Episode V , speaks of her as being beautiful and very sad . We have always wondered how that was possible , and now we know she was speaking of Bail Organa's wife as her mother . Anakin Skywalker was a short little thing to properly and believably portray Darth Vader . I mean , let's face it . . . Vader was 6 ' 7 "" tall , while Christensen has only just made it to 6 ' 1 "" . We now know that he was extensively rebuilt by Emperor Palpatine , including metal extensions for both lower legs . eye rollsWe now also understand R2D2's total dedication to Obi Wan and the Rebellion , more clearly . The Millennium Falcon is visible as Obi Wan and Anakin are just landing outside the Jedi Temple at the beginning of the movie . It can be seen in the lower right of the screen . The TIE Fighters are introduced here in their first incarnation . Padmé's body was made to appear still pregnant for her funeral in order to deceive those on the Dark Side into believing the babies had died with her . This action would prevent Vader from seeking out his child / ren . Obi Wan knew how to project himself to Luke and Yoda from beyond the grave due to Yoda asking Qui-Gon Jinn to return and teach Obi Wan the secret higher Jedi arts . But all in all , and I'm not speaking for everyone here , as a Fan , I really hoped for more . I did not EXPECT more , but I dared hope for it . We got Chewbacca YAY ! , but we got him for a second . We got Wookie soldiers and a Wookie battle , but not the huge effectstravaganza-filled Wookie War we were promised . We got Yoda in battle , but this time he looked more like a spider monkey on crack than ever before . We see Anakin changing into Vader , but the reasons were just stupid . We got Padme in childbirth , but she delivered 3 month old at least babies ! Those were SO NOT newborns ! C3P0 is full gold . His silver right front bottom leg piece is gold in this Episode . I'm sure that will be rectified with the DVD release . Also , no attempt is made to explain Obi Wan's aging 30 years in the 20 years it took Luke to take us to meet back up with him . Further , it takes no notice that Leia appears 10 years older than Luke in Episodes 4 , 5 , & 6 . I'll also assume that this work was meant to indicate that Wookies live for an extraordinarily long period of time , as no attempt was made to make Chewbacca appear any younger than he did in Episodes 4 , 5 , & 6 . The volcano planet where Vader literally becomes Vader and is confronted by Obi Wan was very reminiscent of Mordor . That whole scene bore some interesting parallels : Obi Wan was betrayed by someone he thought would help the Jedi cause , they fight , one is destroyed by fire while reveling in his moment , one way or the other , and both heroes in both situations were accompanied by trusted loved ones who could not help then in their moment of need . One had a magickal ring , the other had a wedding ring . I was happy , I must say , to see that there were no nipples on Bail Organa's Batman armor and that they chose to show the annihilation of the younglings on camera , rather than off . It made for a much more poignant moment that way . The crop circles in fire on the planet's surface in the opening scenes and shots were amusing to me in that they were so prominent yet placed in the background so as to attract the subliminal mind to think , "" Oh yeah , this is an alien space-scape , alright . "" And R2D2 has some new tricks ! He can jump , shoot laser fire , squirt out an oil slick , and he now has turbo fire rockets on the bottoms of his rolling casters . He can also laugh . ( Check out the scene where Bail Organa orders C3P0's mind to be wiped ! ) For now , Star Wars , Episode III : Revenge of the Sith rates an . the Fiend : .","This is probably one of the better spoofs / parodies today . In my opinion , while it doesn't come close to Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein , Robin Hood : Men in Tights , or Spaceballs , it does rank with the Naked Gun and Airport movies .

24,"The first Michelangelo Antonioni movie in color , Red Desert stars Monica Vitti whom audiences would by now be already acquainted with after the successful and acclaimed trilogy with L'Avventura , La Notte and L'Elisse . While much has been said about Antonioni bringing about a stark palette of colors which highlights the inner psychological turmoil of the characters , or use it to great effect to talk about the negative effects man has on his environment just like how deadly the yellow was representing sulphur , it did plod on a little especially when it dwelled upon the usual relationship factor between its lead characters . Vitti stars as Giuliana , a woman whom we see in the beginning and get quite uncomfortable with , as she purchases an already eaten piece of food , and going off to a corner to munch on it with much satisfaction . We learn she's a neurotic , a creation of a vehicle accident , and pretty much obsessive compulsive as well . She has funds to open a shop , but doesn't know what to sell . She has a son , but doesn't know what to do with him and is at wits end with his malingering ways . Her husband we get to see for just a bit , but this isn't exactly a story about him too . Without Vitti in the lead role , I think the fascination with the character ends there . Vitti through her charisma manages to hold your attention , and possibly through this role , highlights her prowess as a commendable actress . I guess it is through her great performance here as an explicitly portrayed confused woman , that made sitting through this story bearable , because otherwise , we'll be stuck with Richard Harris ' Corrado Zeller , a rich industrialist with a one track mind , and that's to bed Vitti's Giuliana , at whatever the cost . And his attempts don't fall short of persistent as well , with his constant probing , requesting , so much so that he's desperate personified . In between their emotional and physical tussle , there were some episodes which stuck out like a sore thumb , perhaps due to my lack of understanding why they should be part of the narrative . One such scene is the story of a young girl which Giuliana tells her son , complete with enactments , which suggests some significance to it . The other though was quite interesting , where a supposed sexual orgy is to have taken place , but what we got to experience was a whole host of party games that a group of men and women engage in , which actually bordered on the weird . Needless to say I didn't really enjoy the story nor any perceived message it tried to bring across . I do however , continue to admire what Vitti can do within the confines of an Antonioni movie .","One negative comment for this little comedy of manners , it's a little unfair . I would tend to be more generous towards Franck Landron's effort which has the merit to bring to the light of day a social phenomenon rarely explored in cinema : naturist communities . I agree with the precedent viewer who deemed the end of the film underwhelming because unexplained . Alacrity seemed to be prevailing in the director's mind when he shot these ambiguous ending sequences . What do Olivier ( Alexandre Brasseur ) and Sophie ( Barbara Schulz ) really think about ? Are they ready to settle down in the camp or do they want to abscond and go back to their humdrum daily life in Paris ? While I'm on the drawbacks , it will also certainly be easy to fault on certain derivative points of the story . We learn that Olivier purchased this house because he didn't want to spend his holidays at Sophie's mother's . Could there be a stormy relationship between him and her ? Then , the values of this close-knit naturist community make the film a little outdated and falsely modern because it harks back to the hippie culture which used to laud a return to nature and the basic pleasures of life , notably free sex . But Landron's effort shouldn't be dismissed all the same . The title of the film designates the people who wear clothes in a nudist camp and so Sophie and her children are them . Her wary demeanor makes sense : in a society so much concerned with fashions in clothing and sense of decency , how many people would be ready to take their clothes off and to follow the rules and manners of a nudist community ? It is highly likely that many people including me and you would react like her . "" Les Textiles "" is a call for tolerance , integration about the right to live naked in an isolated community . There's nothing crass in Franck Landron's treatment of nudism and he films without complacency and a certain neutrality , Sophie's stay on the island among its naked inhabitants . Comical sequences are efficiently subdued . "" Get your clothes off ! "" says some inhabitants to Sophie . It is also to his credit to have reduced the danger of some traps which seemed inevitable like a latent voyeurism and he plays on evocative colors between bright ones during the day and dark ones in the evening . A special cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style . Don't be fooled by the low rating and give this social comedy a go .",317399,1219578,False
25,"One sub-genre that was popular in the decade of kitsch ; the 1980's , was teen comedy . This is a good or a bad thing depending on which side of the fence you're on , but whatever side ; this isn't a particularly good example . As a big hater of Animal House , me writing this review begs the question "" why did you bother ? "" The answer to that is probably because I liked the title . It has a fun ring to it , and I reckoned that a title like that should spawn a good film . While the film isn't essentially ' bad ' , it does have a strong scent of deja vu following it around , and while I aren't a guru on the subject of teen comedies ; even I have seen the stuff in this movie before . It's got all the clichés , from all the kids getting stoned to the geeky kid getting off with the hottest babe in the school . The plot , as you might expect , is paper thin ; and it follows the story of a couple of nerds that move to a new college and immediately find themselves at the mercy of a fraternity of football ' jocks ' , who see fit to tease the nerds because they're nerds . This film came to my attention after the nerdy character in American Splendor gave it such high praise . From the way he described it , I was expecting something in the way of intelligence and maybe even characters that you can identify with . I don't know , maybe real life nerds who went to college in America will find the events of this film similar to events in real life and will therefore find this uplifting or whatever , but for a non-American schooled , non-nerd ; there isn't all that much to like . Some of the jokes are funny , such as the ' cool ' nerd's poker skills against a less savvy player , but many of them are silly in a not-very-good way . Younger audiences will almost certainly enjoy the nudity that the film features , along with some of the more childish jokes ; but for the serious cinema buffs amongst us ( me included ) , this is lacking even for an 80's teen comedy .","This isn't really my kind of flick , but for a silly , savvy date movie - Hitch isn't all that bad . It's obvious that if it wasn't for Will Smith , this movie would never have been made - but he is clearly cut out for roles like this , and even while sleepwalking ; Smith proves that he can still entertain . The film tries to leap over it's obvious layer of ' entertainment ' and deliver a message that has far more substance than the film does - namely , that love is blind , anyone can fall in love with anyone , love knows no boundaries blah blah blah . To incorporate this message into the plot , the film has had to smother itself in sentiment , and this is what ultimately brings it down . When will filmmakers learn that to make people care , you have to stay away from sentimentality ? The scenes that see the characters open up their hearts are largely painful , and this takes away from the film . Hitch does have a surprisingly large amount of things going for it , mostly springing from the performances , but this all falls flat when it starts trying to deliver it's message . . . with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in the face . The plotting can , at times , make Hitch hard to enjoy . Some plot points are either left out or not explained very well initially , and this means that the viewer has to try and piece the story together themselves as the film moves on , which can be very annoying . The film is also a good twenty minutes too long . Writer Kevin Bisch obviously wanted this film to be more than it is , and that is shown through the aforementioned ' message ' and far too many scenes that go on too long . Still , the writing is actually quite good - and scenes in particular that see Will Smith and Eva Mendes bound dialogue back and forth are good and will please the film's target audience . This film is clearly aimed at the casual movie going public , so it's probably a little unfair to criticise this against it's more serious counterparts , so I wont bother . Will Smith may not be one of the best actors of all time ; but he's quite clearly a star . Even from his early days in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air , Smith has stolen scenes and enforced himself throughout , and really ; if it weren't for him ; this film would have failed .",2248099,2248099,True
26,"Waking Life  is not an easy movie to explain . Portraying the philosophical adventures of a young man , the movie does some mind-blowing things . Certainly the animation is not like anything that you've ever seen . As to the question of whether or not the movie is trying to make a point about anything , I guess that it's looking at the current state of the world . Did I like it or not ? It is definitely worth seeing , but not for those with short attention spans , or who just want to be "" entertained "" . This movie is closer to "" The Seventh Seal "" than to most of Richard Linklater's other movies . Check it out .","This is at least AS good as the original , but I have to say I like it more . The bear ( Bart ) is a delight , and upstages Murphy to a totally unintentional and therefore hilarious latitude . Actually , this installment is a tad smarter than the original flick , in that it gives the girls a little more screen time , and that's a good thing , but they spend the majority of that screen time on the WRONG sister , in my opinion , since Kyla Pratt is the sister who will carry on the series . I enjoyed this story far better and could therefore more easily ignore Murphy by virtue of the children actors and the trained animals . I thoroughly enjoy this installment , but mainly because of the bears and their dialog , and not at all because of Murphy . It rates a on the Family Movie Scale .

27,"This is a fairly entertaining horror comedy which is somewhat marred by the usual action shots that move so fast you could be looking at about anything . The deal is , that there's a group of people that are randomly drawn to some low-rent desert watering hole and then trapped in there by some marauding critters that came out of nowhere . I kind of liked the mini-bio's established for each character , and their life expectancy . Especially , Hero , Heroine , and Heroine number two , which of course means that while you may think you're being given a tip to the character's fate , you're really not . Anyway , when all these folks are in this place playing pool , drinking , etc . , some stranger rushes in and tells them that "" they're coming "" and that you'd best be prepared . So of course they all close the shutters and nail stuff over the doors and windows and yet critters still manage to get in . Now the critters themselves , I mentioned , are a bit hard to see , but it seems that their true identity is masked by dressing up in roadkill , for some reason , but you do get to see what they look like later , somewhat . The characters in this are mostly pretty good , stereotype action-horror flick types , including cowards , leaders , wise ones that sort of hang back , a guy in a wheelchair , an old lady ( whose bio , by the way , said something about having done something for Mick Jagger . . . recently . . ) . Anyway , this is entertaining enough but not quite as good as expected , and I actually liked some of the humor more than I liked some of the "" horror "" . Oh , and Jason Mewes is in this , briefly ( life expectancy : exceeded all expectations already ) . , kind of fun but nothing fantastic .","The Monster Squad  is not Academy Award winning material , but it's a fun movie and there's enough for adults to enjoy that it's a film for about any age . Except perhaps , for some of the language , which really , I don't care about , but the little five-year old girl does say "" chickens "" , so that might be about it for SOME family viewing . There's a small group of kids that have a tree house and a club , and they're self-proclaimed horror fanatics . Little do they know that trouble is heading for their little town in the way of a plane full of monsters , on their way from Transylvania . Seems that years ago there was an attempt made by a gentleman named "" Van Helsing "" to stop these monsters but it failed , somewhat , and now they're back & this group of kids has to save the world from them . Dracula seems to be the real instigator of the group , and there's also a Frankenstein monster , a Gill Man , a Werewolf , and a Mummy . It's amusing to see this little 5 year old girl playing near the water's edge and to look up as a shadow falls over her , in a takeoff from the original "" Frankenstein "" . Although she shows up with the monster in tow , and proves that she's a bit braver than the kids that won't let her join their club . At any rate , these kids team up with a strange old man who lives in a creepy old house , that turns out to be German . He says he knows something about monsters , while showing his concentration camp tattoos , nothing kids would probably understand , so there is a level of this aimed at adults . It seems that one of the kid's sister can read German and she says she's a virgin ( a requirement , it seems ) so she's reading the incantation that will send the monsters back & has the magic amulet but nothing seems to be happening , and she does finally admit she's not a virgin ( but THAT guy didn't count . . . ! ) , so the five-year old is commissioned to read the passage with the help of the old man to dispatch the monsters into the limbo from which they can't return . Good special effects and an overall creepy but fun atmosphere really make this worth seeing , and it's never boring or dull . , good fun but caution should be used for younger kids , most likely .",2911571,2911571,True
28,"I would only suggest the films of Michelangelo Antonioni to those who are extremely serious about film . He is an underappreciated auteur , and this underappreciation comes from the enormous difficulties his films raise . In fact , his films are kind of difficult to find . I've only seen two , L'avventura and Blowup . These are his two most famous and most studied films . If you read down the comments on this page , you'll quickly notice that many people do not like this film . I do not blame them . Initially , it can be boring . In fact , the film becomes more interesting after contemplating it long after it is over . After contemplation , and on subsequent viewings , this film seems a lot better . The same goes for L'avventura . And when you begin to think about , and then when you begin to read other people's comments and opinions , you will instantly notice that there have been dozens and dozens of rather disparate interpretations , with most of them even making sense . This provides a rare treat , an intellectual challenge . POSSIBLE SPOILERS My personal interpretation ( I just finished watching it for the second time , without having seen it for about 3 years ) : Thomas , the photographer , is a man who seems to have everything he wants . He is wealthy ( at least a little ; he does express the desire to be even wealthier at one point ) , and people are at his whim . He treats them whichever way he wants . This especially goes for women . He is a fashion photographer ( THE fashion photographer ; if you ever see a movie or a tv commercial with a man snapping pictures frantically at posing models , it is based on this film ) , so women are practically knocking down his door to get him to manipulate them . It has all become too easy for Thomas . He is like the proverbial spoiled child : having got everything he wanted , he has become profoundly bored with it . Because of this , he runs away from a monotonous shoot to a park , where things happen spontaneously . He chases birds and photographs them . Then , suddenly , eureka ! A couple going about their lives as if no one were watching them . A challenge ! Reality ! Thomas jumps into bushes to get closer , as if a National Geographic photographer glimpsing rare animal behavior . As he is leaving the park , the woman of the couple does notice him , and chases him down for the film . For Thomas , life is again back to normal . He joshes her cruelly , letting her know that he is controlling this situation . Thomas goes back home ( I'm skipping over some important stuff , but I'll stick to the meat ) , where the same woman ( Vanessa Redgrave ) is waiting . Again , he controls the situation , and lets Redgrave know that he is controlling it , finally sending her on her merry way with the wrong film . When she has gone , he develops that film from the park . As he scours it , he discovers that he may have taken pictures of a murder . This does not disturb him . Actually , it excites him , almost sexually . He has been having virtual sex with the women he is seen photographing all through the film , but he only really gets aroused at this ( in fact , an orgy scene which arises a few minutes from this point does little but distract Thomas , and when it is over , he kicks the two women from his home rather forcefully , and then goes straight back to his scouring and blowing-up ) . He is aroused , I believe , because of his inability to truely control this situation . It is like riding a wild stallion . Having blown the photographs up to an abstract mess , Thomas decides that he must examine the murder site . There he finds the body which he believed he saw in his photos . He goes back to his pad , and finds the place ransacked with only the most blown-up photo he has of the incident left behind . It is abstract , and he is instantly unsure whether or not he did see the corpse when he was in the park . He tries desperately to tell his friends , but they could not care in the least ( they joke about it ) . His sexual excitement has transformed into frenzy . He is not used to these sorts of emotions , and has no idea how to control himself now . He goes on a wild goose chase after a woman who looks like Redgrave from the back . A friend , high on pot , finally tells him to relax and go to bed . When Thomas wakes in the morning , he immediately goes back to the park , unsure of his experiences in the past couple of days . No body . The excitement is over . But wait ! A group of mimes ( see Ebert's explanation through the external reviews link ) has started to mime a tennis match nearby . Thomas watches these people simulate the sport . Although neither balls nor rackets exist , Antonioni subtly inserts the sounds of a tennis match in sync with the mimed actions . One of the tennis mimes hits the invisible ball over the tennis court fence , and signals Thomas to go and get it . Thomas does not even question the ball's existence ( Antonioni playfully moves the camera as if the tennis ball is actually in the center , even having the camera bounce after the invisiball has hit the ground ) . This invisible object is no less real than what he is experiencing in everyday life , and also than the games of invisibility that he has been playing for the last couple of days . After Thomas throws the ball back , he wavers . What to do now ? Well , his choice is finally just to disappear . He has completely lost control of the world around him , and his only recourse at this point is simply to null his own existence . He does not do it bitterly ( one of the greatest things about this film is the audience's change in attitude over Thomas ; at first , we despise his cruelty and spoiled nature ; now , we pity him ) , but almost willfully . Nonexistance is not such a bad option sometimes .","Spoof on the blaxplotation films of the 1970s . Starts right off in "" Any Ghetto U . S . A . "" where a young black man has died of O . G .

With a couple of older black men ( all from the 1970s films ) they decide to clean up the town . Now it sounds pretty stupid - - but it actually works . There are some real bad jokes but the good ones outnumber those vastly . The whole cast plays it straight with plenty of small roles or cameos from veteran 1970s actors . You don't have to know the old films to enjoy this but it does help a few times . It's really good to see Antonio Fargas back in a film making fun of his 1970s image . John Vernoon ( Dean Wormer from "" Animal House "" ) is also lots of fun as Mr . Big . And Ja'net DuBois is hysterical as Jack's overprotective mother . And - - since this is directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans - - most of his family shows up in small roles . Sure it's silly and stupid but also very funny . Turn off your brain and enjoy !

29,"Back in 2003 , 25-year-old director James Wan debuted his 10-minute short film Saw , winning enough acclaim and attention to produce and direct a feature film based on the concept of self mutilation for survival . The 2004 Saw was , in my old opinion , brilliant . Now I don't think so highly of it since the endless sequels have tarnished its reputation . Saw II was boring as hell and featured moronic characters that deserved to die . Saw III , which I believed was pushing its luck , wasn't any better . And now , 2 years later , and with Jigsaw himself long , long dead we have the fifth ( or should that be Vth ) , which takes ' pushing its luck ' to a whole new level . Despite being stone cold dead , Jigsaw's work is being carried on by a mental cop who could actually bore people to death instead by being such a crap character . The guy has one facial expression . Five people are trapped in a yadda yadda yadda . . . blood , dismemberment , CGI gore effects , blah , blah , blah . If I were in that giant trap I would have gotten free without a scratch since there are several big flaws . These movies have become a parody of themselves . Everything that we've seen in the previous four movies is all here . The icky atmosphere , the stock cop characters , the dull victims and the unshocking shock twist as the Saw theme tune builds up to a big finish . The plot tries to explain most of the questions we've been asking since the beginning , but still fails to make a whole load of sense . Just how the hell can dying Jigsaw , barely able to even get out of bed , manage to find the time to stalk his prey , set up ( and pay for ) all his traps without ever being caught ? Saw V tries to tell us he has been in league with our mental cop from the beginning but he is already as established killer when the first meet each other , so that ain't gonna work out . And what happened to Doctor Gordon ? I've been waiting four damn years to learn of Cary Elwes ' fate after the heavy bathroom door was slammed shut in Saw 1 ; a movie which cost only $1 . 2 million dollars to make and earned back $103 million back worldwide , before the million different DVD releases . Never one to turn their back on a cash cow , Lionsgate have cranked out one Saw film for every Halloween since 2004 . Saw VI is already planned for next year . They will be milking this ugly goat until doomsday . I fully expect to see Saw LIII in 2056 when I am 76 years old . Jigsaw will still be in it somehow , and it will also feature some convoluted method of tying in fifty-two previous sequels into one giant , idiotic plot . Don't let the tagline fool you or let you get your hopes up either . "" You Won't Believe How It Ends . "" I DO believe that it will never end . Now , gimme some Police Academy 5 : Assignment Miami Beach .","Right , let me begin by saying that the tagline of this film is wrong . ' The true story that inspired Scarface ' . Um . . . isn't Scarface a remake of a film from the 30s ? And wasn't the bulk of Scarface's writing and production already complete by the time this documentary really gets to any story in it's chronological order ? If you like watching TV shows in which you're bombarded with endless montages of unsourced and random facts then this is for you . But seriously , I have seen better production values on Channel 5 . Calling this TV quality stuff is an insult to TV . The editing is all over the place and it frequently looks like the filmmakers are trying to edit together a sentence that wasn't actually said . If you have seen the episode of The Simpsons in which Homer is interviewed on TV by Godfrey Jones then you'll know what I mean . Credit must be given to the crew for actually managing to track down the majority of the drug dealing scum and murderers for honest and open interviews . But with practically no archive footage to work with the film looks incredibly bland . It's also way too long and you'll be looking at your watch by the 80-minute mark . A sequel is in production ( oh , lucky us ) detailing the life of the Psycho Woman in charge of it all , but you'll excuse me if I have more interesting things to do , like licking the dust from the skirting board behind the radiator .",102816,102816,True
30,"This cartoon is part of the Color Classics series that Fleischer Studios did when they decided to try and out-Disney Disney , with varied degrees of success . This one owes as much to the lush musicals of the early 1930s as it does to any animated studios and has the typically grand visual effects that were one of the Fleischers best assets . Here , even when trying to be sweet and sugary , there's a little dart or two just to keep things from getting too saccharine . Good effort and one of the better Color Classics .

Well worth watching . Recommended .","MINOR SPOILER IN SECOND PARAGRAPH . "" Citizen Kane "" is , without a doubt , one of the greatest American films ever made . Orson Welles was basically handed the keys to the city - he had everything he wanted and complete control over budget , actors , script , and more . He plays Charles Foster Kane , who dies at the beginning of the film while uttering the immortal words "" Rosebud . "" So the film starts off by searching for what "" rosebud "" really means . We see countless relations of Kane interviewed . None of them know what "" rosebud "" really means . But as the film goes on we see glimpses of Kane's life , and eventually the mystery unfolds itself . Like Akira Kurosawa's "" Ikiru , "" "" Citizen Kane "" is a glance at a man's life and what has driven him to bitterness . Kurosawa claims he never saw "" Citizen Kane "" before making his film , but nevertheless they form a nice back-to-back viewing . "" Citizen Kane "" has , perhaps , some of the best makeup ever seen on film . A twenty-four-year-old Orson Welles is easily disguised as a sixty-something , overweight man . ( And this was before he actually WAS overweight later in his life . ) I recently bought the Special Edition DVD with a commentary by Roger Ebert , who said in his commentary that there are probably more special effects in "" Citizen Kane "" than in the "" Star Wars "" films . Though subtle , I have to agree that there truly are many special effects used in the film . They're so flawless it's hard to even notice . Another thing Ebert pointed out is how low the ceilings are , which creates a feeling of paranoia . All these things work on a subconscious level that you don't really pick up on the first time . And if you want symbolism , this film is for you . As Kane hands over his empire in one scene , he walks over to a window , which to the naked eye looks normal-sized . But as Kane nears the window , guess what ? Turns out the window is very , very high . It makes Kane look small . Think about it . He's handing over his empire and growing smaller in his wealth . It's all very symbolic . I recommend picking up the DVD ; it also contains a two-hour documentary called "" The Battle Over Citizen Kane , "" plus many , many more tidbits , including the original theatrical trailer ( which is very odd and original ) . All in all , "" Citizen Kane "" is a classic of epic proportions . One of the very greatest American films out there .",583640,1173088,False

32,"Robert Walker admirably goes all out as a psychotic daddy-hater who befriends tennis pro Farley Granger and discovers the rather naive young man hates his estranged wife ; Walker suggests swapping murders . Lots of intricate plotting in the set-up , but this Alfred Hitchcock thriller is relieved of tension by its banalities , such as the vapid dialogue , an overlong tennis sequence near the finale , and silly situations like the one where Walker "" cleverly "" winds up in his father's bed when Granger arrives . The frenzied finale plays well , but with some afterthought you may notice how emotionally hollow it is , what with an innocent , elderly carnival worker getting shot dead by the police ( ! ) and nobody seems to care . Flamboyant , if over-the-top , performances , a great deal of style in the usual Alfred Hitchcock fashion , but not much substance . from","This is a short documentary about a very strange period in Hungary between WWI and WWII . At first , you really don't know what the film is about and are intrigued . You know that a certain part of the country has been dying a slow death - - with people moving away from Nagyrev for decades . The people being interviewed talk about how it used to be a nice place to live but now they can't get anyone to buy their homes if they , too , wanted to leave . This , combined with talk of poisonings , convinced me that this town must have been a place destroyed by industrial poisoning of the water or land . However , the film was not about this at all and I was taken by surprise . Yes , people were poisoned but it turns out the whole thing was intentional ! It seemed that the husbands were being lazy and brutal so instead of divorces ( which were morally wrong ) , the ladies decided to poison the men instead ! ! It seems that this became a rather popular pastime in this and surrounding villages ! This story is told through interviews with a few surviving people who were there when the poisonings occurred . However , most interviewed must have learned about the poisonings from family members since it happened so very long ago . Additionally , the film seemed to take a very neutral position on the incidents - - or perhaps excusing it in a way . The women interviewed some times talked as if the murders were somewhat justified and you could detect a certain hostility towards men in a few of the interviews . This wasn't a totally bad thing - - showing this undercurrent of acceptance and condoning of the killings was creepy but also made for a better and more shocking film . I just hope this film isn't adored by ardently anti-male viewers who might see this as a strongly pro-feminist film - - which it should not be . Fascinating though occasionally slow and disjoint , this is a documentary well worth seeing - - just don't get any ideas ! !",989035,2467618,False

A woman's husband dies of a heart attack before she can get mommas money and she hides the body and tries to endear herself to the matron of the family to inherit . Unfortunately , she stumbles upon a hidden secret and is hacked to death . Soon after , a poacher loses his head . Bodies are piling up and no one discovers them . But the family doctor suspects one of the two remaining brothers is off his rocker and uncovers a secret that cost one life . He proceeds to get the murderer in the open . Can he keep his head ? One must watch this interesting tale to find out .","The first thing you notice about this film is the racist MPAA . Despite it being rated PG for war violence , there was nudity . Breasts were exposed , but they weren't those of Barbara Parkins ( "" Peyton Place "" , Valley of the Dolls , and her skintastic moment in Breakfast in Paris ) , but of African natives . Seems that black breasts are not taboo for children to see . But , to the film itself . It is actually two films . The first half in 1912 , has Lee Marvin ( Cat Ballou , Paint Your Wagon ) as a drunken ivory poacher who manages to get Roger Moore ( The Spy Who Loved Me , "" The Saint "" ) to partner up with him . After Moore and Parkins ( Marvin's daughter ) plan to marry , there is a great fight scene reminiscent of many John Wayne pictures . Then the film changes . World War I is declared and the Germans are on the march led by Reinhard Kolldehoff ( Moon Over Parador , "" The Winds of War "" ) , a big fat German pig whose men slaughter Moore and Parkins baby , and set them on a search for revenge . The film has plenty of action , including what I would call a paper mache bi-plane which almost takes Moore's life , and culminates in the blowing up of a German battleship that had run over Moore and Marvin earlier . Marvin was extremely funny and Moore looked just great painted black to get on the ship . Parkins was radiant throughout , even when consumed with revenge for the murder of her baby .

34,"The Stranger is a little slow to start . Edward G . Robinson , playing a war crimes detective named Wilson , lets loose one of the right-hand men of an important Nazi war criminal named Franz Kindler ( Orson Welles ) who escaped prison and managed to erase his identity . He was the mastermind behind the concentration camps . No photographs exist of him , and only this goon might know where he is . Wilson tracks the goon to a small town in Connecticut , where Franz Kindler is posing as a history professor about to marry the daughter of an important politician . Immediately the goon disappears , but the professor arouses Wilson's suspicion . After the setup is over , The Stranger bolts ahead at a breathless pace . All the clues point to the professor , though there is nothing definitive . When his wife , Mary , finds out ( played by Loretta Young ) , she refuses to believe it . Kindler feeds her a nice lie explaining everything , and she's desperate to believe it . He's not sure that he can trust her . Welles pulls a ton of suspense out of the situation . He's so good at creating points of tension out of both the simplest means , like a group of college boys on a paper chase , a dog who won't stop digging in the leaves , or something much more gothic , like the ancient , broken-down clock in the church tower . Kindler was an expert on clocks ( which is one of the biggest clues ) , and when he revives this old monster , an iron angel with a sword chases away the devil and then rings the bell to the hour . To get to the top of the tower , an extraordinarily tall ladder must be climbed . This leads to as much or more suspense as existed in the cognate scenes in Hitchcock's Vertigo . In fact , I'm sure Hitchcock watched and liked this film . Everyone knows he admired Welles ' later Touch of Evil , which he mimicked in his own Psycho , so why not this film ? The acting is quite brilliant as well . We would expect it from Orson Welles , of course . This is actually one of his very best roles . He is amazing at telling believable lies to his wife and friends , but with the dramatic irony in which the audience is in possession , we see the depth and the nervousness and the evil . Edward G . Robinson has a pretty thankless role for a long time , but nearer the end he begins to expand . We cringe when he coldly suggests that Mary is in mortal danger . He is simply great in the climactic scene ( which I won't mention except to say that it is one of the best in film history , although some might find it a bit silly ) . Loretta Young is also great as a naive wife who so desperately wants to be the perfect wife and believe everything her husband says . If this movie were to be remade today , her character would have been developed further psychologically , but what is here is good . She is also great in the climactic sequence . Welles ' films often have thriller elements , but this is his most thrilling . It's also probably his least philosophical , and almost certainly his most conventional . He made the film as a concession . I think he was allowed to make The Lady of Shanghai in return , which is an even better film than this . That is no matter , though . It's a masterpiece anyway . .","I always find movies and actors that are willing to lampoon themselves and their own business to be a breath of fresh air , and "" Tropic Thunder "" is nothing but Hollywood lampooning itself . If you've found this comment , you likely already know what this movie is about , so there's no need for a summary from me . I'll just say that I thought it was very funny , and proof that Hollywood is capable of making a comedy that can be enjoyed by adults . The principal male cast gels wonderfully , even if Robert Downey Jr . completely steals the show as a dude dressed up as a dude playing another dude , with even the big name actors in cameos ( I'm talking to you , Tom Cruise ) doing their material justice . If Hollywood is going to insist on making disposable formula films , at least it's a comfort to know that IT knows that it's making disposable formula films .

36,"Walking out of the current ( October 2004 ) revival of the Craig Lucas play I overheard a couple talking about the film version of the play and it suddenly came back to me why it all seemed familiar , I saw it on TV several years ago . The story of how a woman who's husband can't take her any more and hires a hit man to kill her , only to send her away before he arrives is a very strange story . No one and nothing is who they seem to be . And the twists and turns seem rather random . The whole bit about visiting every Springfield in the country is just plain dumb . The dialog is clever at times but mostly it seems forced . Worse is the fact that this probably should never have been made into a film . The play which is full of whimsey and is stylized does not translate into a film well . The actors are okay but many are completely wrong for the roles . The Goldwyn / Farrow coupling doesn't quite work so the story isn't believable from the get go . If given the choice of play versus movie go for the play where the whimsey works better , however you would be better off renting or seeing pretty much anything else . for the bits that work . Side Note : Mary Louise Parker who plays Pootie and a couple other members of the cast of this film are in the current Broadway production . Obviously they are gluttons for punishment","A lot of people trash this movie , but I beg to differ . I won't bore you with the story , its the details that make this film .

37,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one ; I went in expecting nothing and actually found a more than decent horror movie . The film is directed by Michael Armstrong , a British man who would go on to direct the excellent ' Mark of the Devil ' a year later . The title is a bit misleading as it makes the film out to be a haunted house movie , when in fact it's closer to the slasher genre if anything . The film takes place in sixties ' swinging ' London and focuses on a group of young friends . They're out one night and looking for a party when one of them suggests that they go to an old house that is supposedly haunted . Their party turns sour when one of the friends gets sliced by an unseen killer and , believing they would be in trouble with the local bobby's if they come forward , they decide to dispose of the body themselves . I have to admit that the film is really quite predictable and even though it's a "" whodunit "" , there's never a great deal of mystery surrounding anything in the film . The film is very well shot , however , and the director does a good job of capturing the swinging sixties feel . It's also a very colourful film , which is nice . The acting is rubbish of course , but that's not too important and it all boils down to a nice little twist at the end . I can't say this is brilliant stuff ; but it's not bad and worth a look for horror fans .","TerrorVision is apparently a horror-comedy ; but I have a problem with this . Any horror in the film is laughable ; but like the rest of the movie , it's not laughable in the funny kind of way . No , this film is just lame , and unlikely to be enjoyed by anyone over ( or under ) the age of ten . I'll get the positive elements of the movie out of the way quickly so I can comment on the more prolific bad elements of the film . The film is about a newly installed satellite dish that begins to receive signals from another planet . These signals are apparently ( and fittingly ) another planet's rubbish that they've converted into energy to get rid of it . However , a trash monster is accidentally beamed down , and begins to cause trouble . To director Ted Nicolaou's credit , he does create a good and fitting atmosphere , as the film always feels like one of those tacky TV shows that America makes . The film gets off to a lively start with a daft song that is played over the opening credits , and a glimpse at the offending alien world . The good points end there , however , as it's all downhill from then on . We are introduced to an array of irritating characters , including a punk girl and her ' Bill and Ted ' style boyfriend , a swinging pair of parents , the common ' senile ' grandfather and some kid who hallucinates , apparently . From there on out , it's obvious that there's going to be little in the way of interesting elements in this amazingly dull film , and despite the scriptwriter's best efforts at being funny ; this film really is anything but . Aside from being lame , the film is also boring as most of the running time concerns the characters wallowing in their own weirdness ; and all this showed me is that swinging can be very boring ( not that I've ever actually tried it . . . ) . The creature effects are purposefully silly , but look like something out of a kids program ; not a proper movie , and since the film focuses mainly on the kids ; it does feel very much like a movie made for children , and so in unlikely to offer anything in the way of enjoyment for serious horror fans . I do realise that this is meant to be a bit of fun and isn't to be taken seriously ; but it's not fun and that's the problem . Avoid .",2248099,2248099,True
38,"Though Vincent Price had a long and varied career , most horror film fans will know him by a trio of movies from the late 1950's - "" The Bat "" ( 1959 ) , "" The Fly "" ( 1958 ) , and this one - "" The House on Haunted Hill "" . When I first saw this film shortly after it's original release , it gave me the heebie jeebies for a week , especially having seen it alone in the dark . Today it doesn't affect the same response , but still , it's got a lot going for it and is a well written , creepy and atmospheric drama in which Price and a host of characters are given a chance to shine . The opening set up is quite classy - Elisha Cook's character Watson Pritchard is the owner of the house , and he snares the viewer with an immediate hook ; seven violent murders have taken place in the house including his own brother . Price is Frederick Loren , the current resident , an eccentric millionaire who offers five people seemingly chosen at random , ten thousand dollars each if they can survive a night in the house . Pritchard , an alcoholic , doesn't let up throughout the film , he insists that dire consequences will occur - "" Only the ghosts in this house are glad we're here . "" The film's first real fright catches you off guard , as Nora Manning ( Carolyn Craig ) examines an empty room , she suddenly turns into the haggardly face of the home's female caretaker , though we don't know that yet at this point . It's the kind of face you would make if you were trying to scare your little sister coming downstairs in the dark - funny but effective . There are other subtle events that keep you guessing , all done with an effective purpose and not just for shock value , a rarity in today's films . One of the better ones makes use of a thick rope that crawls it's way toward lead screamer Nora , but this time she's speechless , fixated on the ghostly image of Loren's wife Annabelle floating outside a window . The relationship between Loren and his wife Annabelle ( Carol Ohmart ) makes up a key plot element in the story . It's no secret that they share a tense relationship , Loren the jealous husband , and she the one willing to stick it out for a huge inheritance once he's met his demise . As the grim party of five come to believe that Loren is out to kill her or one of them , they all agree to remain in their rooms till morning to stay safe . Yeah , right ! Now wouldn't it have made more sense for all of them just to stay in one room all together ? But then , no murder , mystery or mayhem . The movie is peppered with some great lines , and Price's character gets his share . Commenting on his marriage , he offers - "" What husband hasn't at one time wanted to kill his wife ? "" But my personal favorite , and you'll have to see the film for it's proper context , is "" Do you really think there WAS a head in her suitcase ? "" Other clever elements are inserted as well , the coffin party favors with a handgun for each guest is a neat touch . Then there's the basement , a veritable fun house replete with a floor vat filled with poison acid . It's a real treat to see how Vincent Price literally "" pulls the strings "" of this murder mystery whodonit in the film's finale . Observation : freeze frame a close up of Carol Ohmart in her role as Mrs . Loren - doesn't she resemble what a mature Paris Hilton might look like ? "" The House on Haunted Hill "" remains on my yearly must see list , I'm sure you'll have fun with it too .

39,"This is one of the less famous films starring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn and after having seen it again recently , I can see why . While their performances are excellent ( particularly Tracy's ) , the movie itself is a bit hard to believe and comes on a bit too strong . I'm sure this is a result of the time in which it was made , as the film had a very strong injection of patriotism and Americanism thanks to our being brought into WWII . In many ways , the film was like a variation on MR . SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON , except that Smith dies and in the end you find out he's a Fascist ! ! The film begins with the death of a famous American patriot and all around great guy . However , despite a tremendous outpouring of sympathy , his widow refuses to see or talk to anyone . . . that is , until reporter Spencer Tracy appears . Then , slowly the story of this great man begins to unfold , though over time Tracy can sense that it's all a put on - - there IS some secret that they are trying to hide from him . In the end , the secret is revealed and Hepburn inexplicably dies - - and I really didn't understand why she so quickly died and Tracy seemed just fine even though he was in the same burning building ! The film does have a few plot holes ( like the one mentioned above ) and at time it lays it on a bit thick , but still , based on the charisma of the stars , it's still well worth seeing . Just don't expect magic .","I gotta admit that if you watch this film today and don't understand the context for it , then you will most likely not be particularly impressed . It's such a very simple animated short and one that seems amazingly ordinary - - something you could easily make today given the right rendering software and a home computer . However , think back to 1984 . People rarely had home computers and those who did had systems that had major compatibility issues - - with not much more power than a modern calculator ( less in some cases ) . There were no hard drives - - those that did exist were minuscule . Macintosh computers were yet to come and IBM compatible computers used primitive versions of DOS and many were using Commodore and other simple computers . And , most importantly , most games were either text only or had very , very rudimentary graphics . In this context , ANDRE AND WALLY B is absolutely amazing and breathtaking . The Pixar folks were not yet a big company but just a few individuals doing work on huge computers and they had to design all the software themselves ! ! And , in spite of all this , the graphics were lovely and the story of a cute bee quite watchable - - even though it was really more an experimental film than anything else . Oddly , while this film is not terribly exciting today , I still prefer it to a couple of the later Pixar films ( such as RED'S DREAM ) . A great start .",2467618,2467618,True

His friend Charlie ( Jonathan Stark ) , a music agent , arrives with his new diva discovery Jana ( Amy Yasbeck ) to help him thru the unfamiliar first few days . The house is where Jesse's parents were killed when he was just a baby and it full of many curiosities . Crafted in a bizarre Gothic-Aztec style the house itself is a marvellous set and the many rooms and passages are as mysterious to us as they are to Jesse . Sitting on one of his many mantelpieces is a crystal skull that fascinates him for some reason . He even misses his housewarming party while studying the skull's history . His studies lead him to dig up the grave of his great , great grandfather , or Gramps ( Royal Dano ) , where he discovers the old coot isn't dead just in limbo . The person who possesses the skull is granted eternal youth but it also warps the space-time continuum within the House . Gramps comes home with Jesse , is more enthralled by Kleenex boxes and TV than the mysteries around him and ducks for cover whenever someone from another time comes to steal the skull . Just like the first movie different rooms lead into different time zones . Jesse and Charlie have many hilarious adventures battling caveman , dinosaurs , Aztecs an evil cowboy called Slim . The one that killed Jesse's parents and betrayed Gramps over a century ago . House 2 has so much careless abandon and zany plot twists that it is totally impossible not to love this movie . The huge success of the first movie meant that this one was put into production literally and hour later and Ethan Wiley was given the budget and green light to do whatever he wanted . How often does happen today ? Usually it would make for a bad movie considering this was the first movie Wiley directed . But it makes for an unusually cute and light-hearted supernatural romp . One of the weaker aspects of this sequel is that it has more SFX and animation by Phil Tippet's stop-motion workshop and less by Dreamquest . The matte paintings are gorgeous but the dated dinosaurs look hokey in a few shots . If you can just squint during these moments you won't notice . Bill Maher from TV's "" Politically Incorrect "" even manages to show up as a music producer who is interested in Yasbeck and mighty suspicious of Jesse's antics . John Ratzenberger ( this makes both movies star one of the "" Cheers "" barflies ) appears as a repairman / adventurer who assists Jesse and Charlie battle some Aztecs . Look out for Kane Hodder ( Jason ) in an ape costume . Jesse adopts a fluffy , little baby pterodactyl and a strange creature called a Caterpuppy , a cross between . . . well you know . You need an open mind and a suspension of disbelief to swallow the outrageous goings on in this movie . The commentary is better than the one on the first movie . Ethan Wiley and Cunningham get on well and have no quibbles pointing out how crazy the film is . They discuss the budget , tell tales of the late Royal Dano and explain how many of the effects were pulled off within the constraints of the budget . One of the most interesting things they mention is that even tho the movie was stuck in between The Color Purple and Beverly Hills Cop II the kids still preferred House 2 as their fave movie of the summer . But because the movie didn't have it's own opening weekend , unlike the original , it wasn't as successful . Didn't stop 2 more sequels being made . A theatrical trailer is also included . Much like the first film the picture has been brilliantly transferred onto DVD . The 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic picture looks super with very few glitches . Colors are rendered with pleasant accuracy and you wouldn't believe the low-budget origins when judging this picture . There is some grain during darker scenes but other than this the movie is looking great . The Mono soundtrack is not terribly engaging and most of the film's sound is centre-channel biased . But there's no hiss or pop to worry about . It may be Mono but it's clean and fresh sounding to me .",3717154,102816,False

Now think about this - without ever questioning why she might have been traipsing around in her undies , the couple spends a week together before Martin pops the question . Not exactly the best recipe for a lasting marriage , but then again , there have probably been odder scenarios . The fact that you never even see a ' Fly ' in this movie shouldn't come as a let down ; the whole idea of the picture supports the premise of a Delambre legacy that resulted in tragedy the first time around , and continues to rear it's ugly head , or other mutations as the case may be . The creature effects are reasonably daring enough without going over the top , thereby helping to maintain suspense throughout . If I were rating the trio of pictures in the ' Fly ' series , I'd place this second to the original starring Vincent Price . Brian Donlevy is convincingly conflicted and creepy enough to take up the Delambre mantle as he tries to keep his sons in line with the scientific mission . Besides the principals , Burt Kwouk and Yvette Rees are convincing as the loyal Asian servants , but one has to wonder - Tai and Wan - Taiwan ? Who makes this stuff up ?","This is probably the craziest of all 30s screwball comedies , and it seems almost impossible today that it could have bombed when first released in 1938 . I'm not sure Katharine Hepburn was ever much of an actress - - I think she was good at picking roles in which she could just be Katharine Hepburn . But when she set her mind to playing ding-bats , she could be as ditzy as the best of them , and her character here may just be the ditziest ditz ever captured on film . Cary Grant was sort of a male Kate Hepburn in a way . He was never really called upon to act ; directors just hired him whenever they needed someone to play Cary Grant . But the befuddled , exasperated character he creates in this movie is sensational , even if it didn't require Grant to flex his acting chops . Together , Grant and Hepburn are an unforgettable pair , and they make an unforgettable movie . It seems pointless to mention specific classic scenes in a movie in which every scene could rightfully be considered a classic . But my favorite just may be when Grant and Hepburn go charging around her family home's extensive grounds , chasing after the dog George . Not to be missed by anyone who enjoys film comedy .",2707735,4532636,False
43,"In the vein of THE LONGEST DAY ( 1962 ) and BATTLE OF THE BULGE ( 1965 ) , this one’s basically the equivalent of BATTLE OF Britain ( 1969 ) – as well as a sort of companion piece to TORA ! TORA ! TORA ! ( 1970 ) . For this reason , it tries hard to be as authentic and detailed as possible ( with stock footage of the real WWII battle and constant captions indicating names of places , vehicles and personnel ) but then doesn’t allow much acting opportunity to its star-studded cast : with this in mind , the contribution of James Coburn ( as an officer who mistrusts the information denoting Midway as a probable enemy target ) , Robert Mitchum ( more on his character later ) , Cliff Robertson ( as Heston’s former buddy and superior to his pilot son ) and Robert Wagner ( as Commander Henry Fonda’s aide ) results in being especially negligible . Charlton Heston is the nominal lead : he’s seen having problems with son Edward Albert over the latter’s inopportune relationship with a Japanese girl ( when the latter continues to mope about his personal situation , Heston snaps in his inimitable fashion : "" You better shape up , Tiger , or some hotshot Jap pilot's gonna flame your ass ! "" ) . Henry Fonda is , as ever , the authoritative figure – playing the Admiral in charge of the defense operation at Midway ; Glenn Ford is Mitchum’s low-ranking replacement ( the latter appears as the well-known Admiral Halsey , who’s been confined to hospital due to a skin disease : apparently , the bulky and notoriously laid-back actor could have chosen to play any real-life character involved but deliberately opted for this thankless role – even so , he lends a welcome dose of humor to the proceedings , especially when he rebukes Ford , who wants to shake Mitchum’s hand for displaying the utmost confidence in him , with "" You want us to lose the war ? ! "" ) . Hal Holbrook is the enthusiastic old-timer who first detects , through a coded message , the Japs’ intention to attack Midway ; Robert Webber is the Commander of one of the three U . S . cruisers who see action during the famous and decisive battle . Monte Markham is the intelligence officer whom Heston approaches to intervene for the Japanese girl and her parents , who have been detained ; Christopher George is unrecognizable in the cock-pit as one of the leaders of the various flying squadrons involved in the dogfight sequences . Toshiro Mifune and James Shigeta are the most renowned actors on the Japanese side ( one can notice the effort they all did to speak their lines in English ! ) – the country’s defeat at Midway was clearly the result of over-confidence ( brought on by a previous victory , albeit a sneak attack , at Pearl Harbor ) and constant bad judgment on the part of the officers concerned . Incidentally , just for the record , the film features three actors from the cast of THE YAKUZA ( 1974 ) – which I’ve just watched – namely Mitchum , Shigeta and Christina Kokubo ( Albert’s girl ) . The various strategies by which the battle was fought maintain reasonable interest throughout , and the action sequences – which virtually take up the last third of the running-time – are certainly spectacular enough . Hell , even the domestic asides emerge to be less distracting than I had anticipated ( though the same can’t be said of the few scenes from the so-called "" TV version "" of the film included among the DVD supplements , which introduce the useless character of Heston’s much-younger girlfriend ! ) ; having said that , this added footage does dwell a little on Heston's inability to fly due to a hand injury ( which , of course , has a bearing on his eventual fate ) . In the long run , however , I feel that MIDWAY comes across a bit stiff as entertainment .","An all-night Italian TV program entitled "" Fuori Orario "" - which translates to "" After Hours "" - comprised of back-to-back films of all genres , nationalities and vintage , and hosted by an eccentric highbrow critic named Enrico Ghezzi - has for years been the fount of several interesting titles which , if it hadn't been for him , I would never have heard of , let alone watched ( though I'd say that about a third of the alarming 500 + still-unwatched films I own on VHS are culled from that program ! ) . Anyway , FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES is one such example : when I learned it was scheduled to be shown , I made a cursory search via the Internet about the film and , from the little I found , I singled it out as one to record . However , I didn't watch it immediately ( mainly because , unfortunately , the tape I used for the recording was some 20 years old and still has a habit of halting playback automatically and subsequently refusing to load ! ; in fact , a couple of weeks back I lost two early Shohei Imamura films I unwisely taped on a similarly fragile VHS ) but , since that time , I've come across a few more references to Matsumoto's film - most recently its being announced as a forthcoming Region 2 DVD release from the impressive "" Masters Of Cinema "" label - which have only intrigued me even more . Then , yesterday , as I was listening to Tony Rayns ' Audio Commentary for Hiroshi Teshigahara's unusual debut PITFALL ( 1962 ) - incidentally a Eureka / MoC edition - he mentioned the film once again ( and , perhaps unwittingly , proceeded to give away the devastating plot twist at the film's conclusion ! ) in the context of its similarly unconventional nature . So , this time , I decided not only to watch FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES at long last - whatever the condition of the tape which , fortuitously , turned out to be not too bad - but , being in something of an art-house / Asian cinema vein , I made a whole list of ( mostly just as obscure ) titles to follow . . . Now , after this long-winded introduction , let's get down to the business at hand : a potentially off-putting subject matter ( the trials and tribulations of a community of transvestites ) is transformed by the writer-director's aggressively experimental style , drawing on the contemporary free-form technique of European films rather than the cinematic conventions which are traditionally Japanese . In fact , the narrative ( if it can even be called that , in view of its many flashbacks , flash-forwards and repeated actions ) is frequently interrupted by having the cast sit down for interviews being filmed by a TV crew ; interestingly , Ingmar Bergman's contemporaneous THE PASSION OF ANNA ( 1969 ) used a similarly unique device to "" explain "" his characters ' motivations , as it were . Despite its generally serious tone , seemingly a requisite for an art-house film , FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES is not devoid of humor or , at the very least , a distinct sense of the absurd : the catfight scenes between the "" women "" are shot in accelerated motion - a technique allegedly borrowed from this film by Stanley Kubrick for A CLOCKWORK ORANGE ( 1971 ) ! ; the scene of a trio of transvestites taking a leak in a men's lavatory ( much to the consternation of those present ) ; the linking image of a line-up of naked men with one of them having a rose firmly planted between his butt-cheeks ; a revolutionary hippie named Guebara having a sneezing fit in extreme close-up ; and the moment during one of the pauses for interviews when a crew member slinks past the camera filming the actor playing the man pretending to be a woman ( are you confused yet ? ) holding a dead rat by the tail ! With regards to Peter , the lead actor ( who , amazingly , later turned up as The Fool in RAN [ 1985 ] , Kurosawa's masterful adaptation of Shakespeare's "" King Lear "" ) , I have to say that he makes for a very convincing female impersonator - to the point where , if it weren't for his clearly masculine voice , one forgets that he's actually watching a man in drag ! The love scenes ( which , thankfully , aren't very explicit ) are sensitively handled and , in general , the film doesn't sentimentalize the gay community - nor does it criticize the drug scene which seems to be as much a part of their lifestyle as anything else . As I said earlier , I knew of the film's reversal of Greek tragedy at the climax from Tony Rayns ' commentary for PITFALL but , given its complex structure , I was still blown away by the revelation which , in turn , leads to an extremely violent ending that is not easily forgotten . By the way , I found the brownish hue of the black-and-white cinematography to be an interesting touch : I don't know if this was done intentionally , or whether it was just a feature of the print I happened to watch - but , at this juncture , I think I'd be somewhat disappointed if this unique "" dirty "" look were missing from the film once the upcoming DVD is released ( perhaps anyone who might own the Japanese disc could chime in about this ? ) . . . FUNERAL PARADE OF ROSES was , by all accounts , an remarkable debut feature for Toshio Matsumoto ; he followed it with only 3 more films but , from the little I've read about them , they sound interesting too and well worth seeking out ( so far they have only been available as part of a Japanese Limited Edition Box Set , though not all the films feature English subtitles ! ) .",1399158,1399158,True

She's preparing her home to be rented the next day - except the renter , an attorney named Professor Lightcap ( Colman ) shows up right then . Since Leopold has a bad ankle , Nora lets him hide in the attic . Though Lightcap wants peace and quiet to write a book , things don't quite happen that way . Nora insists on being his secretary / cook - because she has to take care of Leopold - and every time Lightcap turns around , there's Nora's mother , the police looking for Dilg , furniture deliveries and a delivery of all of Nora's clothing - before he agrees to hire her . Nora and Dilg's attorney Yates ( Edgar Buchanan ) attempt to drag the brilliant ivory tower attorney into the unfair assumption of guilt of Dilg , but Lightcap refuses . His type of justice , it seems , is all on paper . He doesn't want to get involved with any real people . Leopold , posing as the family gardener , gets into some heated discussions with him , and at Leopold's urging , Nora gives Lightcap special attention . But is any of it enough to make him cave and help Digl ? This is a grand comedy with very serious undertones . Who would ever expect two of the most elegant men in film history , Grant and Colman , to be facing off in a comedy , no less , where one of them is very definitely NOT elegant . Grant is terrific , a truly great actor who rarely let his audience see anything but the famous "" Cary Grant "" persona . Here , he's a man of the people with a clumsy walk and casual clothes . His pantomime to Nora through his attic window of wanting something to eat is hilarious . The bearded Colman plays the role of a stuffy professor very straight . Lightcap is barely able to stand the chicanery of Nora's household at first , as he has a strict routine . Fast forward and he's flirting and dancing with a smart-mouthed beautician ( Glenda Farrell ) in order to pump her for information about her boyfriend . His acting , particularly his courtroom speech toward the end of the film , is magnificent . Arthur plays Nora as a dizzy , confused and nervous woman , completely thrown as a landlord , a friend and a woman by the appearance of Leopold and the brilliance of Lightcap , as well as his admiration of her . She's torn between the two of them - and keeps the audience wondering .

Except for the return of Pei Pei's Golden Swallow role , Chang Cheh's movie doesn't share any similarities with King Hu's original , clearly stamping his own take on his movie utilizing the lead character from Come Drink With Me , and relegating her to supporting role status . As a fan of the original , this is downright disappointing , as I had expected to see Pei Pei kick some serious rear again as the fabled swordswoman . Instead , what we get is a story involving a love triangle of sorts , with costars Lo Lieh as Golden Whip Han Tao , a man who saved Golden Swallow from bandits and nursed her back to health , and Wang Yu as a beau from long time ago , who now calls himself The Silver Roc . The Drunken Cat , with whom Golden Swallow rode into the sunset with , is clearly forgotten and totally written out . In actuality , this movie can be renamed The Silver Roc . The story centers on this figure , an orphan bearing a scar on the forehead similar to Harry Potter's , and is one of the fellow disciples to Golden Swallow's teachers . Disappearing one night to seek revenge on his family's murderers , he resurfaces to look for Golden Swallow , and does so by killing villains in her name , in an attempt to lure her out of seclusion . Being the self-proclaimed number one swordsman with an attitude helps too , and not before long , our trio will meet , with Golden Swallow being indecisive about both alpha males , that they have to duke it out to settle scores . In Chang Cheh's signature ketchup blood style , this movie doesn't lack in the gore department , with really bloody scenarios , dismembered bodies , slashes to face and an inspiration to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , albeit done in a more straightforward manner . But some of the kung fu moves seemed recycled from One Armed Swordsman , especially Wang Yu's Silver Roc , who holds his sword akimbo similar to his One Armed days . And his much revered "" Coup De Grace "" killer move was never seen until the finale , and that too was too weakly executed and laughable . I wondered too about numerous scenes where characters liked to leap out of windows , clearly to a mat at the bottom , out of the screen . But one thing's a bonus , and that's having plenty of outdoor shots versus indoor studio ones , which boosts production values a little . Still , it's a decent martial arts flick , but one which could have been miles better . With Wang Yu hogging too much of the limelight with his character in this movie , it suffers by neglecting the other leading characters by Lo Lieh , and especially Cheng Pei Pei , because the movie , after all , is named after her Golden Swallow , or in the original English title , it's the Girl with the Thunderbolt Kick ( apparently it's a misnomer , she doesn't have that skill , nor executed any recognizable kicking moves ) . If anything , watch out for a young Wu Ma as Hu Zhen , a supporting character and friend of Golden Swallow and Han Tao . Nothing memorable , but just a getting a kick out of recognizing a star ( to me at least ) in his earlier youthful looking days .",342623,317399,False

Particularly amusing were the comments directed by Jan to a monster kept inside a closet ; it was fairly interesting the way the movie built up curiosity as to what this monster would look like . The handsome Evers is rather under-stated as the determined doc , with Leith contributing much of the camp appeal as the yappy severed head .

55,"This disappointing giallo does offer some atmospheric sequences and lots of nudity , but the story progresses in a very fragmented fashion , making it hard for the viewer to even tell the characters apart , and the gore effects are embarrassing , actually some of the worst I've ever seen in an Italian horror film .

However , that doesn't say much ; considering "" Torso "" ' s obvious disregard for credible motivation , the killer could have been just about anyone .

When her character is happy , her whole face brightens up and her joy becomes infectious ; when she's sad or confused or embarrassed , the emotions come across strongly , although she never goes over the top . Considering that she lost the Oscar to her co-star , Shirley MacLaine , who is reasonably good but far more one-note , I'd say we had a major Academy Award injustice there . Jack Nicholson is fun to watch and has some amusing lines , and most supporting roles , like those played by John Lithgow and Danny De Vito , are also first-rate and completely believable . So overall it's a good film , directed almost flawlessly , although in the final 20 minutes it needlessly wallows in melodrama . ( )",386241,386241,True
56,"This special about The Great One is hosted by Jeff Garlin of "" Curb Your Enthusiasm "" . He basically just stands there and mentions many things about what makes Jackie Gleason what he was . His widow , Marilyn Taylor Gleason , is also interviewed about her late husband's work habits-such as his refusal to rehearse more than once-and about his characters that he showcased on "" The Jackie Gleason Show "" during the ' 50s . Among his characters that we see clips of : The Poor Soul , Fenwick Babbitt , Joe the Bartender , Rudy the Repairman , Charlie Bratton the Loudmouth , Reginald Van Gleason III , and , of course , Ralph Kramden . Of course , many of those clips also have second banana Art Carney in them especially the Kramden ones where he plays the scene-stealing Ed Norton . There's also an Audrey Meadows one in which she doesn't play Alice Kramden : a Reginald Van Gleason where she plays his girlfriend Monica who wants to marry him . Reginald responds by literally sending her to the moon ! Many other funny sketches abound though both Rudy and Charlie may be a little too obnoxious for my tastes . While I do love "" The Honeymooners "" , the scenes picked for this special seem to emphasize the arguments of Ralph and Alice too much and not enough on the great chemistry of Ed and Ralph and , by extension , Art and Jackie . I did love the "" Can You Do This ? "" game show sketch that Fenwick enters and many of the Gleason dances especially one where he danced with Marilyn . I also loved The Poor Soul sketch where he fails at bowling and the various Joe the Bartender monologues . And I admit liking one story Charlie told Clem ( Carney ) about his uncle , a garbage man . This special only showcased Gleason's work on his ' 50s TV variety show .

The disappointment grows further because this story and Tim Burton's directorial style are clearly a match made in heaven - but for some reason , a terrible decision was made on how the film would work and it's spoilt something that could have been great . I would write a song about this film's main problem - but I'd prefer to clearly state that it's the musical elements that spoil it . The plot is rich with horrific elements and should be a great base for a gory Gothic horror film . We focus on Benjamin Barker ; better known as Sweeny Todd , a barber returning to London for revenge against all those that have wronged him . Upon his return to the capital , he meets Mrs . Lovett , the owner of a pie shop where "" The Worst Pies in London "" are made . If I made the worst pies in London , I'd keep my mouth shut about it - but she sings songs instead and unsurprisingly her shop isn't doing very well . Anyway , Sweeny Todd opens up a barbers shop upstairs and his lust for killing soon combines with her need for meat to put in pies . I have to say that the film looks great . Tim Burton has his own directorial style and it translates to the screen very well here and aesthetically , every scene is a joy to behold . The good points continue with the cast ; Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch and he clearly relishes this role , while Mrs Tim Burton ; Helena Bonham Carter , does well starring opposite and the director has also done a good job recruiting some good British talent to fill the supporting roles . The film is also rather graphic and Burton provides the viewers with some real nasty sights including a spate of throat slashing that result in blood spraying everywhere , a succession of corpses falling through a trapdoor and hitting the ground with a brutal thud as well as a machine that grinds Sweeny Todd's victims into pie meat . This is all well and good but it all comes down to the execution , and the musical elements really spoil it . Many reviewers have said that the horror and musical elements bode well in this film ; but for me it really doesn't work . It comes off as being almost cringe-worthy in places and constantly forced me to ask myself WHY they made this a musical ( I know there was a musical version of this story , but there's also several none musical versions ) . Another problem with the music is that it all sounds very similar and the songs are not very diverse . The first hour or so is really rather boring anyway and the constant singing soon starts to grate . Things improve massively towards the end and despite a couple of songs ; the final half hour is really quite good . Overall , I love the atmosphere and the gore of this film - but I can't get on with the musical elements at all , which unfortunately means that a film which could have been a masterpiece is sadly not much better than passable . A shame .",11228318,2248099,False

Check it out .","I viewed the Turner-Time / Warner print of this movie . ' The Fire Brigade ' is a firefighting drama which also manages to be a piece of propaganda for firefighters . . . as if these brave souls needed any spin control . There are several firemen characters in this film , and without exception all of them are depicted as brave , resourceful and selfless . No pyromaniacs or cowards , as in the later ' Backdraft ' . The fire-fighting sequences are exciting and well-staged , often making the actors seem to be in genuine danger . . . and the film-makers are clearly pleased to show these fictional firemen using the very latest ( genuine ) fire-fighting equipment , vintage 1926 . I fear , though , that modern viewers would laugh at much of this equipment , which of course is primitive by modern standards . Also , this movie's soap-opera subplot considerably dilutes the excitement . Charles Ray plays the latest in an Irish-American family of firemen . He's engaged to marry Helen Corwin ( May McAvoy ) , the daughter of a wealthy building contractor . Unfortunately , her dad ( Holmes Herbert ) is a crook : he has knowingly committed safety violations in several of his buildings ; this increases his profit but it also means the buildings are firetraps . You can see where this is heading . The final scene is exciting , with Ray trapped on a burning rooftop with a golden-haired little girl . Tom O'Brien is excellent as Ray's older brother , who is a member of the same fire brigade . DeWitt Jennings , an underrated actor , is splendid as the fire chief whose job is made more difficult by conniving politicians . ' The Fire Brigade ' saddens me because of the fate of its leading players . The very beautiful blond May McAvoy and the handsome Charles Ray were both stars in silent films , but they plunged into obscurity very quickly when talking pictures arrived . May McAvoy was the leading lady in the early part-talking film ' The Jazz Singer ' , although she had no lines on the soundtrack of that movie . But soon she had to face the microphone : her talkie roles revealed that she had a lisp and an indecisive manner , and the sound revolution proved she wasn't much of an actress . The tragic course of her career is summed up perfectly by two of her credits : in the 1925 silent classic ' Ben-Hur ' , May McAvoy was the leading lady . . . and in the 1959 remake of ' Ben-Hur ' , May McAvoy was a faceless extra in the crowd scenes . Charles Ray's career followed a less spectacular version of the same arc . He was a star in silent films , usually playing good-hearted country boys . His voice proved unsuitable for talking films , and soon enough he was working as a dress extra , wearing a tuxedo in nightclub scenes . That's show biz , I suppose . I'll rate ' The Fire Brigade ' .",865972,1609079,False

60,"SPOILERS Way ahead of it's time movie that disclosed to the movie going public back in 1949 that there's a sub rosa government working independently from the laws that govern all of us . Which it's far more destructive then any outside enemy , like at that time the Soviet Union , ever was . Hard to follow at first when we see a man Max Von Brog murdered at his printing shop on 506 East 31 st in Midtown Manhattan by a hood known as Knuckles , George Breen . Mr . Borgs wife , Hester Sondergaad , claims that her husband committed suicide . Later she's picked up at the airport trying to flee the country to Mexico City terrified of those who murdered her husband and feeling that she might well be next . Mrs . Von Borg is put into protective custody by Assistant D . A Malloy , Franchot Tone . Local columnist Charles Riggs , Myron McCormick , feels that those who murdered Von Borg , whom he was printing leaflets and posters for , are highly connected in government and that the suspicion of them belonging to some hate group "" The Crusaders "" . A subversive group that his friend and Assistant D . A Howard Malloy thinks are just a front for their real activities . Later when Riggs goes home to his apartment he's murdered by Knuckles and like Max Von Borg Knuckles makes it look like Riggs killed himself by throwing him out the window . Malloy now with a personal reason to find the killer and those behind him starts making inroads into this group "" The Crusaders "" . Malloy starts by tracking down the person who did the art work for their posters a Mrs . Sigmund Kosterich , Hedley Rainne . It's from Kosterich where he gets the name of a young woman Barbara Whitfield , Jean Wallace , who he's doing a painting of and also seems to be involved with this mysterious group . Going home one evening Malloy is attacked by Knuckles who he knocks out and disarms . After checking his wallet Malloy finds a business card for a person call "" The Angel "" Angelo Agostini , Marc Lawrence . It turns out that "" The Angel "" runs some charity outfit in the city . After Malloy has a talk with "" The Angel "" everything seems to open up for him where he's appointed Special Prosecutor by the Governor . This after he met with Mrs . Hartley a major NYC political king-makers at a big social party who's also a close associate of "" The Angle "" . It seems that those in power , Agostini Mrs . Hartley etc . etc . , are trying to buy off Malloy to keep him from finding who and whom their working for . But it doesn't work with the brave and honest Malloy and leads to a shocking and bloody final in the movie . It turned out that the group "" The Crusaders "" were just a cover and a microscopic part of the real power clique that controls the city of New York if not the entire country . Ground-breaking film who's story has been copied hundreds of times since it's release back in 1949 about those in power who answer to no one but themselves . With both Franchot Tone & Jean Wallace very effective in their parts as the somewhat naive D . A . Who finds out the truth the hard and deadly way . With Jean Wallace as the young singer who also finds out , too late , that she's into something that she had no idea of how dangerous it was . The movie "" Jigsaw "" has a number of top Hollywood stars in cameo roles and top NYC news & gossip columnist Leonard Lyon who wrote the popular "" The Lyons Den "" newspaper column . That showed just how important the movie was to them for them to want to be in it . Only the ending was a bit too contrived and phony but with the Hayes Commission back then controlling the US film industry a happy ending was a must in a disturbing as well as dark Film-Noir movie like "" Jigsaw "" .","Trying to deal with time travel stories often makes my head hurt , because it sets up a whole set of ' what if ' scenarios . For example , when Dr . Buchanan ( John Hurt ) produces Mary Shelley's ( Bridget Fonda ) book "" Frankenstein - or , The Modern Prometheus "" , wouldn't natural curiosity have compelled her to read the story she hadn't written yet ? And in doing so , wouldn't she have changed certain parts of the story , or even added the character of Dr . Buchanan into it ? One's mind reels at the possibilities . Focusing on that aspect of "" Frankenstein Unbound "" would have been provocative enough , but the film gets deeper into science fiction territory with Buchanan's particle beam weapon and it's side effects of missing persons , time slips and weather disturbances . The number of throwaway scenes that did nothing to propel the story forward surprised me , starting with that warrior on horseback that appeared when the youngsters were burying the outmoded bicycle . Buchanan himself hallucinates a couple of dream sequences that don't connect to anything and have no bearing on what eventually happens . Dr . Frankenstein ( Raul Julia ) is an interesting character . Disturbed and protective of his creation at the same time , it's ironic that he takes no responsibility in the face of an innocent girl's death by hanging for the murder of his younger brother . To him , his only rationalization can be - "" I'm a scientist , I cannot sin . . . "" Probably a plus , the film doesn't dwell on the creation of The Monster , he's certainly creepy enough without appearing to be a patch job of multiple bodies ; to this viewer he calls to mind my vision of the Swamp Thing . Ironically , the transformation of Elizabeth into the Bride of Frankenstein is visually stunning and a closer tribute to the original in her brief appearance . Ultimately though , it seems the film stumbled around to come up with an appropriate ending and I'm not so sure that was achieved . The character of Buchanan was just as much a villain as Frankenstein and The Monster itself , so having him wend his way far off to the futuristic city just left me with question marks . Perhaps that was meant to be his punishment , along with making him walk instead of taking his trusty talking carriage .",2721657,2707735,False
61,"The film begins with a man breaking into a jail ( Robert Taylor ) to rescue and old friend ( Richard Widmark ) . Oddly , however , it turns out they aren't friends any more and you know that they'll soon reunite and blood will be shed . It turns out Taylor is a sheriff and Widmark is his old partner in crime . This , sadly , is about the only twist in the film that caught me off guard . Despite having Widmark and Taylor in the leads , this is yet another tired old Western - - and in so many ways practically indistinguishable from the countless number made in the 1950s . That's because the film is so predictable and takes no chances - - it's only assets are the stars . Plus , since it's by-the-numbers , you know that by the end of the film , there will be the clichéd shoot-out between Taylor and Widmark . And , in between , there is the rather dull girlfriend , the "" hot-headed "" young punk and an attack by addle-brained Indians - - who , naturally , ride past the cowboys single-file in order to give them a better chance to shoot them ! My advice is find a better Western to watch . While this one isn't bad , it sure isn't good . Plus seeing a middle-aged and paunchy Taylor playing the action hero is a bit of a stretch .","I really liked this film but can't see exactly why it won the Oscar for Best Picture , though I gotta admit that none of the nominated films really stand out in my mind . In a way , it would have been interesting if they'd given out no award in that category , though that will never happen . Now I am not saying I disliked the film . It was exceptional - - just not exactly "" great "" - - especially when there were other Clint Eastwood Westerns before this that were about as good or better . Maybe this is a lot like the film TRUE GRIT . Not a super Western , but John Wayne got the Best Actor Oscar more because of his amazing body of work BEFORE this film than the film itself . What the movie does excel at is creating an aura of an "" anti-hero "" style Western . Not one where you exactly hated all the characters , but one that calls their motivations and actions to question and asks a lot of questions about what makes a hero . And , in this light , several of the characters really stand out in my mind . The most intriguing is Gene Hackman as the sheriff , Little Bill . He is not the typical sheriff-type character . He is neither the consummate hero or an inept jerk that looks the other way when trouble comes - - the two most common types of sheriffs in film . Instead , he is a very pragmatic sadist . Pragmatic because he NEVER faces his enemies alone , but always has a well-trained gang to support him - - like most bullies . And , with this gang giving him the upper hand , he show that down deep he is a sick and twisted man who takes pleasure in torment . I also liked the young punk gunman ( Jaimz Woolvett ) . At first , he was very annoying and brash , but that really helped in the development of his character . He reminded me a lot of the guy Richard Jaekel played in THE GUNMAN - - a young punk trying to prove his masculinity with a gun ( wow , Freud would have LOVED that symbolism ) . But , unlike Jaekel , he eventually showed a very likable and believable bit of humanity . Clint Eastwood was also not the same typical character he usually played . Not "" the man with no name "" like so many Spaghetti-Westerns , but a complex and cold man who used to be a drunken # @ $ % ! & but had reformed when he met the right woman . Then , years later , when he strapped his guns on again , it was pretty unusual and refreshing to see what a bad shot he initially was and how much trouble this old man had getting on the horse . This old and somewhat broken-down tough-guy was also reminiscent of John Wayne's last film , THE SHOOTIST , in that although the body is achy and tired , there is still a lot of man hidden underneath . Morgan Freeman's role was very ordinary and he shows once again that he is a supremely capable actor . The best part about the role was that not once did anyone mention that he was a black man - - a bold move in many ways . Instead , he and his quiet dignity was what was front and center . Richard Harris and the rest of the cast did fine jobs and I have no complaints about the acting . In fact , I have no real complaints at all about the film . The movie deserves its R-rating for graphic language and a lot of extreme violence , though it is not as graphic or offensive as many similarly rated films .

Then there's something interesting that goes on as Edgar Wright gets enveloped in making a pure zombie movie , and , for me , odd as it sounds , it doesn't totally work . I could understand why the shift comes , as danger looms in with the un-dead taking over the British village Pegg and Frost have to defend at all costs . At the same time , it's not quite as fulfilling as the razor-sharp satire and visual wackiness that went on in the main chunk of the picture .

Gone is the grainy low-budget atmosphere of the original , replaced by a larger budget , and an amount of camp as well as satire . It's brutal and unrelenting in its own way , it's just nowhere near as scary . The outstanding set piece has the two unlucky kids terrorized all along the highway by Leatherface ; no matter how many times I have seen this , this is a scene that has always worked . Also , replacing the mere suggestion of extreme violence is more obvious in-your-face gore , supplied by the always reliable Tom Savini , who contributes some great work here . Hopper and Williams are supported by the scenery-chewing Bill Moseley , in his first substantial film role , as the plate-in-his-head Chop Top , Bill Johnson , inheriting the role of Leatherface from Gunnar Hansen and doing a fine job , Lou Perryman as the affable good ol ' boy L . G . , Ken Evert replacing John Dugan as Grandpa ( this guy still doesn't have the strength to bash a womans ' brains in ) , and the still quite delightful Jim Siedow as the wonderfully exuberant Cook . Leatherface here is given a new dimension , as we see him developing a bit of affection for Stretch ; this is another intriguing aspect of the script . Knowing full well that one of the great strengths of the original was its art direction / set decoration , the crew here create a nifty , massive set ( located inside an abandoned theme park ) in which the Sawyers can ply their trade . Hooper and Jerry Lambert also contribute a score that is more conventional than what we got the first time around ; this time , we get to hear some rock songs as well as the usual assortment of country tunes . I've now come to appreciate this sequel more , which I wasn't able to do before . Sometimes when a sequel goes in a different direction than its predecessor , it may take some time for it to grow on you , as this picture did for me .

He will grow to be a man made strong by adversity , but still wondering if he'll turn out to be the hero of his own life . He is DAVID COPPERFIELD . Charles Dickens ' masterpiece comes to marvelous life in this triumphant translation from literary classic into film . Enormous care was taken by MGM to get the look & feel just right - to make the viewer believe they were seeing the novel spread out before them , without a false moment from start to finish . ( The Studio even went so far as to use special on-location exterior filming at Canterbury Cathedral , a segment that only runs for a few seconds . ) The all-star cast is remarkable : Freddie Bartholomew , newly brought from England by his aunt , is perfect in the role of Young David ; his anguish at the death of his mother is almost palpable . Replacing a reluctant Charles Laughton , W . C . Fields proved a triumph in the comic role of the penniless Mr . Micawber , always confident of something ' turning up . ' ( You might think Fields ' American accent & mannerisms would tend to be grating , but he turns in what is arguably his finest performance . Fields had loved Dickens ' novels for years and always kept a few in his vaudeville trunk . He knew the role and how to play it .

The only jarring note is the fact they picked on a fine Cole Porter show and then jettisoned all save one of Porter's songs ( Fred Astaire had starred in the Broadway show , his first since his lifelong dance partner , sister Adele , retired from the stage in favor of marriage , and they probably figured a few thousand spectators would make the connection ) . True , they had the grace to retain Night and Day but the Broadway show wasn't a one-song affair by any means , there was a second fine ballad , After You , and a tasty upbeat entry How's Your Romance but in their wisdom RKO decreed that a gaggle of journeymen songwriters could eclipse Cole Porter . In your dreams , fellas . This initial top-billed teaming set the pattern for those to follow ; Fred is invariably a performer ( except in Carefree ) who falls for Ginger more or less on sight leaving around an hour of screen time for misunderstandings , quarrels and reconciliations punctuated by some high class song and dance by the best in the business . Three of the comedy ' support ' here , Eric Blore , Edward Everett Horton and Erik Rhodes would also be on hand for Top Hat - indeed Rhode's Tonetti is a warm-up for his Bedini in the latter - and only Alice Brady would be replaced by Helen Broderick . With one gorgeous ' romantic ' dance number ( Porter's Night and Day ) and the obligatory novelty dance , The Continental , which occupied more or less the last two reels , this was an auspicious start to a timeless franchise .","Given that this is Bastille Day , a comment on a Pepe Le Pew is appropriate , don't you think ? In this one Pepe is Pepe , of course , and the lines ( mainly delivered by Pepe ) are wonderful . While good scripts were important in most of the series that Warner Brothers did , visual gags tend to overshadow dialogue much of the time . For Pepe to work , the lines need to be funny , as visual gags are a bit limited by the premise and Pepe's personality is part of the charm to be found here in any case . This short has great lines , like , "" You may call me Streetcar because of my desire for you . "" The ending is hilarious . My favorite sight gag in any Pepe Le Pew is in this one . Watch for the scene with the frog , with the frog's reaction to Pepe being the absolutely perfect reaction to have . Rumor has it that the frog here was a cousin of Michigan J .

The effects were mostly good , though I thought the moving corn , was , well , corny ( no pun intended ) . It's interesting , all the way through , and has more likable main characters than your everyday horror movie .

In the end , nobody wanted to take credit for it and it's easy to see why there is no "" Directed by "" credit on the screen . It's a mess . Not only did the directors quit , but ROBERT MONTGOMERY began filming in the Richard Hart role until he dropped out and was replaced . The only redeeming feature of the film is the handsome seaside setting and house that Garson lives in , until a stranger comes along ( RICHARD HART ) to inform her that her husband ( MITCHUM ) is dead and that he was Mitch's best friend during World War II . Garson is soon offering Hart shelter and their relationship seems to be heading toward a romantic involvement when the very much alive Mitchum returns to town , seeking to resume his former life . Actually , these are the ingredients for a potentially strong enough story - - so one has to wonder why the film turned out so disastrously . Mitchum was reportedly annoyed with Garson when she required , according to him , "" 125 takes to say ' No ' . "" ( Knowing Mitchum , this could have been a slight exaggeration ! ! ) Nevertheless , he often spoke disparagingly of the whole project . Can't recommend this one unless you are a staunch Greer Garson fan and won't mind the punishment .","There might be a movement in the future to turn this box office bomb into a cult classic , but it doesn't deserve that . Much in the style of Robert Rodriguez's Sin City , but different enough not to feel like a cheap imitation , The Spirit does look cool . The images are often gorgeous . Add to that a number of pretty women , notably Eva Mendes and Scarlett Johansson , and it's almost worth watching with the sound off . But then you'd miss Sam Jackson's hammy villain , which is fun enough . But after the look and Jackson , there's nothing worth seeing . Miller infamously got a directing credit for Sin City because Rodriguez felt he followed the comic book so literally it would be wrong not to . But Miller here finds that storyboarding is not the same as directing . His tone is all over the place . He's going for over-the-top comic book-style camp , and it works occasionally . More frequently it flops on the ground like a suffocating carp . Miller also doesn't properly establish who any of his characters are , and , especially nearer the beginning , it's difficult to follow the plot . Most of the fault is surely Miller's ( I've also heard that fans of the original Eisner work feel like Miller has put too much of his stamp on the work ) , but the editor is probably partly at fault , too , for the confusion .

71,"The best documentaries manage to do two things at the same time : First they teach those who don't know anything about a subject about that subject . At the same time they will enlighten those already knowledgeable on a subject in some way either with new information or a different point of view . The film Hitler A Career manages to do both . Made in 1977 in Germany I have yet to see a documentary on Hitler that is as good as this . Focusing on Hitler this film basically shows you who he was and why he did what he did . This is Hitler in his words and deeds with some very good narration tying it all together . Take for example the opening sequence of a speech Hitler gave when he came to power . Not only do we really get to see and hear a good portion of the speech but we are made very aware of how Hitler is speaking . The slow building nature of the oratory , the pauses , the hand gestures , its all laid out . I had read about how he gave a speech but until this film I never real saw how he did it . The film then moves on and put Hitler into the context of the time and himself . Its done in such away as to be filled with many "" Ah Ha ! "" moments . We don't see things that don't relate to the man , we just see the things that he did , influenced him and reacted to . Most films on Hitler try to show you some larger picture , this film doesn't , its presenting the man as a man and not a cypher or a personification of evil and the understanding you get is immeasurable . I've been studying the second world war all my life and its rare that I come across a film that makes me rethink what I already knew . Even better is the fact that as I learn more about the conflict as a whole , re-watching this film reveals new facets I never noticed before . I long ago taped this from the History Channel and re-watched it several times . I recently was given a copy on DVD and find that I'm again reviewing it and learning every time . In the thirty years since the film was made there have been way too many films on the Hitler and the Second World War , but I don't think that very many are this good . Certainly I haven't seen a biography of Hitler this good .

She only knows that from her standpoint , life was never dull when Judy was around because she was totally unpredictable . She tells how their lives kept shifting from one situation to another in rapid succession as Judy's fortunes either rose or sunk . But through it all , we see the love Liza had for her mother . The other most detailed impressions of Judy come from Charles Walters , a man who directed Garland in a couple of films ( EASTER PARADE and SUMMER STOCK ) and was her dance director or choreographer on many others . He saw the tragic side of her insecurity due to studio pressure and the competition of very beautiful actresses at MGM to whom she always felt ugly by comparison . It didn't help that Louis B . Mayer called her "" his little hunchback "" . He traced her addiction to pills to the pressures of performing that began when she was very young and kept very busy without a normal teen-age development .

This time , they give the family two dogs , one of each gender , give them each a voice and lets the kids rest their inner voices . Why is it that infants , right from the womb ( which we , again , see , because there apparently can not be an entry in this franchise without that ) , have the voice of people who are about middle-aged , give or take a handful of years or so ? Apparently , even dogs .

Dukakis shows up again , in what can only be loyalty ( in a film with dogs as main characters , how fitting ) . Heckerling neither wrote nor directed this . . . when the very creator of a franchise steps down , you ought to know there's something wrong .

They're all fine films , no arguments there , but they somehow feel like an excuse for younger horror fans to simply neglect the ' dated ' black-and-white originals . The 1930's versions of these tales still form the standard , as far as I'm concerned , and they remain fundamental viewing if you desire to call yourself a fan of the stories . That being said , Brannagh's interpretation of Frankenstein is obviously a good and visually striking cinematic effort , but it honestly won't impress you that much if you're familiar with versions from past eras . Much more than the other aforementioned titles , it too often feels like Kenneth Brannagh intended to bring the ultimate version of "" Frankenstein "" and therefore it occasionally feels preposterous and overly obtrusive . Also , and in spite of some really engrossing moments ( especially during the last half hour ) , the director puts the emphasis too much on the sentimental aspects and nearly not enough on the petrifying side of the story . Quite a lot of footage is dedicated to Victor Frankenstein's private life . His role as obsessed scientist is always second to his role as concerned and romantically tormented patriarch of the Frankenstein clan and therefore Brannagh can't hold a candle to the performances of previous Victor Frankensteins like , say , Colin Clive or Peter Cushing . Even the creature as well , albeit masterfully depicted by no less than Robert De Niro , can't seem to find the right balance between frights and pity ; something that showed almost naturally in the older versions . A lot of material feels like unnecessary padding and slows down the pace whereas the essential parts of the film are not strong enough to rescue the wholesome . The settings and costumes are deeply impressive , as is the whole new make-up job on the Frankenstein monster ( Robert De Niro's mutilated face is likely to shock and repulse the more squeamish viewers amongst us ) , but the film overall fails in the department of substance . Some highly acclaimed actors are offered too little character depth to work with , like Ian Holm as Frankenstein's father and John Cleese as his reluctant mentor , and others can't bear the heavy burden that comes with the character , like Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Brannagh himself . I would easily recommend "" Mary Shelley's Frankenstein "" , but only for the terrific illustration of decors and make-up and , foremost , only after having seen the "" Frankenstein "" ( 1931 ) and "" Bride of Frankenstein "" ( 1935 )","Dynasty Warriors 5 is when you come down to it a standard hack and slash game with aside with some small graphical improvements nothing to differentiate it .

77,"I'm not nearly as fluent in Russian as I'd like to be . One way I gain familiarity with the language is by watching Russian movies ( preferably recent ones , with contemporary dialects ) and trying to follow the dialogue . A friend of mine from Kiev recommended this early Russian sound film to me : although it's officially a talkie , most or all of the footage was clearly shot silent and then post-dubbed . Very little of the story is dependent on dialogue , and so it was easy for me to follow the action . This movie is also interesting due to its location scenes in a part of the world that didn't get filmed very often in the 1930s . "" Earth Is Thirsty "" takes place in Turkmenistan , specifically in a barren desert region where the peasant farmers are barely subsisting . In Stalin's economic system , these people are "" bednyakyi "" ( peons ) . Enter stage left a "" kulak "" ( the Russian equivalent of a hidalgo ) , portrayed by Leonid Vikhrev from the Moscow branch office of the Snidely Whiplash Dramatic Academy . He manages to divert the region's only water supply for the sole benefit of his own land . Nyah-ha-ha ! The starving peasants start starving even faster . But help is on the way , comrade ! Along come the courageous Soviet civil engineers , selflessly dedicated to serving the impoverished proletariat . Using modern irrigation techniques , they re-reroute the water supply back to the peasants ' land . The film has an upbeat finish , with the peasants dancing , singing and celebrating . I have no idea how accurate this movie is . I'm generally quite sceptical of Soviet propaganda films . This one seemed to have a greater ring of accuracy than most others I've seen , but the difference may be down to the fact that this movie's story is more concerned with helping the peasants survive rather than uplifting their political sensibilities . In some ways , this film reminded me of King Vidor's ' Our Daily Bread ' , which similarly flirted with communism and collectivism . And the shenanigans with the water supply inevitably reminded me of ' Chinatown ' . None of the actors here give subtle performances . The peasants are depicted as the honest salt of the earth . . . but OF COURSE they're honest , since there's nothing hereabouts worth stealing . The role of the kulak is scripted as a double-dyed villain , and played by Vikhrev accordingly , so I was intrigued that he doesn't face any sort of come-uppance , nor even a reformation in the style of Ebenezer Scrooge . The film ends with Vikhrev sulking in his dacha while the peasants celebrate . My rating for this one : .","' Public Jitterbug # 1 ' is an excellent example of the sort of nonsense - - often highly entertaining nonsense - - which was ground out by Hollywood studios in the decades when a trip to the movies meant a double feature plus selected shorts . This ' Jitterbug ' is a mini-musical : too brief ( and too ephemeral ) to be a feature film , but longer and more substantial than a mere short subject . Another aspect of movies in the studio era is that they provided occasional showcases for vaudeville performers . Many vaudevillains spent literally years or even decades performing the same act , honing it to perfection . Vaudeville was killed when talking pictures came in , abetted by radio . . . because now a vaudeville turn could perform its act ONCE , on film , and the whole world could see it . Here in ' Public Jitterbug ' we get a character who's completely unrelated to the rest of the film : long-time vaudeville comedian Chaz Chase , who does a speciality act in which he strikes a match , lights a cigarette , takes a drag on the ciggie , eats the lit match , then eats the lit cigarette , then lights another match to ignite the matchbook , then swallows the burning matchbook , and so forth , eventually eating his own dickie . ( The one that's his shirtfront , I mean . ) Chase had performed this act on the Keith circuit in 1922 , and he was still performing it on a television special in the mid-1970s : he does it here in this short too , and it's the only thing he CAN do . There's some vague attempt at a story . A bunch of white guys in suits convene a meeting , which is apparently inside the Capitol building in Washington . ( Erm , Congress aren't using it ? ) America is facing a crisis : everyone is listening to swing music ( gasp ! ) and becoming jitterbugs ( gasp ! gasp ! ) . The white guys vow to find ' Public Jitterbug Number One ' and de-bug this dreaded jitterbug menace . SLIGHT SPOILERS . The number-one jitterbug turns out to be vivacious young Betty Hutton . It's fascinating to see her at this early stage of her career , but frankly she was much better ( and had better material ) a few years later . One of the Federal agents trying to capture her is tap-dancer Hal LeRoy . I've knocked LeRoy in several other IMDb reviews . I hugely enjoy old-style tap dancing as performed by almost anyone else , but Hal LeRoy leaves me cold . I find him extremely effeminate and somewhat unnatural : his body seems too thin , his arms too long , and he holds his arms stiffly at a strange angle whilst dancing . LeRoy's taps are clear and his steps are technically proficient , but there's no joy beneath the taps . At one point , Betty Hutton's character offers to make love to him , but LeRoy replies he'd rather dance . I can well believe it . At the end , the authorities show up to arrest Hutton . Now get this : LeRoy ( who was supposed to arrest her himself ) has fallen in love with Hutton . ( Wouldn't he rather dance ? ) He tells the Feds that Hutton will no longer be Public Jitterbug # 1 . . . because he plans to marry her , appointing himself Public Jitterbug # 1 and thereby relegating Wifey to the Public Jitterbug # 2 spot . I guess this was meant to be a harmless joke , but I found it offensive , since it strongly implies that a wife is always second fiddle to her husband . The couple escape in a hail of bullets , the bullet holes spelling out ' The End ' . Hoo boy ! Betty Hutton's career started promisingly , but self-destructed . I was saddened by how deeply forgotten she was at the time of her death . ' Public Jitterbug # 1 ' isn't the best showcase for her distinctive talents - - I would nominate ' Annie Get Your Gun ' - - but this short film is enjoyable , and it shows off the young Hutton very well . I'll rate this frothy concoction .",1609079,1609079,True

That was black-and-white and made in France while this is 2002 movie in color with English-speaking actors . Usually I'll take the original over the re-make but not in this case . . . . with one major consideration . In order to like this film , I had to play the DVD with the English subtitles on because many of the accents were just too tough to decipher and if you can't understand the dialog , it gets a bit frustrating . The story is confusing enough as it is , so , if you have a similar problem as I had , play this with the subtitles . If there is such a thing as colorful film noir , this would be it , with many splashes of the neon nightlife of France , inside and outside . Story-wise , if you're confused you are not alone . After two viewings , I still haven't totally figured out the twist at the end . The dialog tries to be snappy mid-40s Raymond Chandler stuff and sometimes it's great , other times it's affected .

He uses a unique way of getting out of the situation . Lots of scenes with the villains using the wireless to contact each other as Zorro overhears their plans . HELEN Christian and REED HOWES are two of the most bland performers in the history of serials , judging from their work in this serial .

80,"Americanization of the highly-regarded television mini-series from Britain is , at its heart , the exploration of newspaper journalists ( working under even greater pressure today to grab the major headlines first ) having to deal with police procedure once they've gotten hold of an explosive story - - and to sort out the ramifications of friendship when acquaintances become sources and bosses on deadline are demanding results . A female Congressional aide in Washington , D .

Crowe , playing a scruffy warhorse whose neck is always on the line , teams with cub reporter Rachel McAdams in ferreting out the girl's sordid past as well as the Congressman's ties to a corrupt organization which uses the military for financial gain - - with kick-back to certain politicians . Very much in the same vein as "" Absence of Malice "" from 1981 , this one too has the proverbial montage of a daily newspaper being pieced together from the ground floor up . The characters are equally clichéd , from Helen Mirren's demanding news editor to Robin Wright Penn's benumbed political wifey ( a thankless role for sure ) . Jason Bateman enlivens the complicated scenario with a colorful bit as a kinky supplier , and Crowe does well when he has the opportunity ( a battle of words late in the game with Ben Affleck is well played , and Russell's contempt / compassion for inexperienced McAdams has its pleasures ) . The picture is alert and detailed , handsomely filmed and occasionally gripping .

And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action - smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up , unfortunately of course , to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk , gets smashed . However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed , as there were only a small handful of action sequences , though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago . So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster , which will leave a smile on your face , despite being used in limited doses . But I note though that the story cum action , looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love , and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing ( here being gamma-powered ) , with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too . While there will be those who will gripe about the transformation mainly done in the dark and in shadows , it does prove to be effective in building some anticipation and heigntened tension as to when he will finally appear in full glory . The mainly military attacks on the big guy again brought out some back to basics adversary with Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture the Hulk , and in fact I'd appreciate that this movie didn't divert too much away from this primary objective , although it might be more of the same from the first movie . But while the Hulk has an aura of invulnerability , somehow The Incredible Hulk provided me at least , an emotional pang when he gets hurt bad , as we remember that this is a guy who just plainly wants to be left alone . And the angrier the Hulk gets , the bigger and more powerful he becomes too . And it's not all serious here too , with well meaning humour peppered in the right places , making numerous references to the television series and characters from the Marvel universe . You'd often wonder how his pants stay on before-during-and-after transformation , well , it gets addressed here with humour . Memorable ines such as "" don't - make - me - angry - you - wouldn't - like - me - when - I'm - angry "" gets punned away , even the late Bill Bixby got a cameo , together with Lou Ferrigno who reprises his security guard role , and Stan Lee who's possibly in the most unmemorable cameo appearance ever . The much touted Tony Stark appearance will bring whoops of joy from newly converted fans of Robert Downey Jr , while I suspect in line with the rumoured Avengers movie , the universe now seemed more streamlined again with the references to SHIELD , and stupid me thinking that Mr Fantastic would somewhat be featured in this too . A WWII super soldier project and serum was referenced and formed the basis for Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky turned Abomination , but Captain America ? I'll leave that to you to find out . But what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk is not the action sequences , nor the references mentioned made . It was the central love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross . In Lee Ang's version , we don't see much of the romance between Bana and Connelly because the story didn't really call for it , save for a rescue scene , and at an in-juncture where the Hulk was stopped in his tracks by his lady love . And that was precisely the winner for me . The Hulk , for all his power and unstoppable rage , could be brought under control by his lady love , and that was used to great effect here . Beneath the green invulnerability lies the heart of a mild-mannered man who yearns to be with the love of his life , but unfortunately cannot due to the curse that Fate had brought upon him . Both Norton and Tyler managed to bring out this chemistry of lovers torned apart , one who can only admire the other from afar , and the other finally never wanting to let go of someone who had disappeared from her life for her own protection . And this version of Betty does sport a bit of a temper and feisty too , and is not really your classic damsel in distress . Granted that most supporting characters were rather one-dimensional , The Incredible Hulk somehow managed to straddle between its intense whack-all-destroy-all moments , and tender ones when the lovers are left alone to their own devices . As with the Marvel movies to date , the doors are left wide opened for follow ups and team-ups , and here there are no less than three avenues where the next story could develop further from , and sowed the seed for other movie franchises to be developed too . It drained a little bit from the cerebral department in order to amplify the romance , and let the action go into overdrive . HUlk Smash indeed , this time likely to make a huge dent at the box office , for fans and non-fans alike to be won over , just like how Iron Man did .","Don't watch Udon on an empty stomach , or you'll be tempted to gorge on those Japanese noodles right after the screening . Despite its simple presentation , watching bowls after bowls of noodles in your face , and the characters slurping them down with gusto , somehow leaves you with an imagined flavour in your mouth as they smack their lips , while you smack at nothing . The film is as simple as a bowl of udon noodles , with prime ingredients being the fat noodles , the broth , a sprinkle of spring onions , and an egg . Of course there are the fancy combinations of added condiments and ingredients to spice things up , but unfortunately for the film , it became a story of two distinct halves , with little character development between each half , and contained a little too many subplots that were necessary , bringing the runtime to a whopping 2 hours 15 minutes . I thought the more interesting of the lot was in the first half , where the movie takes a look on fads . Similarly to Bubble Tea or the Luohan Fish fads , what turned out to be essentially fairly good products , boomed in popularity because it managed to latch on the novelty factor , and yet suffered when its 15 minutes of fame was up . Scores of bubble tea stores collapse from the oversupply and people generally being sick of the drink , and the Luohan fish went back to the longkangs . Good intentions sometimes bring about uncontrollable negative costs . But Udon as "" soul food "" , and the highlight of a magazine column , sparked off the rage of the noodle in all of Japan , as everyone descends to the small town of Sanuki where there are plenty of Udon eateries around tucked in obscure corners . The movie follows two protagonists - Kosuke Matsui ( Yusuke Santamaria ) , a failed comedian who tried his luck at New York stand up comedy clubs , and returns to his hometown where his father runs a mean udon shop , and Kyoko Miyagawa ( Manami Konishi ) , a blur like sotong girl who has zero sense of direction . Kosuke , in wanting to clear his debts , and not in good terms with Dad , turns out to work as a salesman of a local magazine , and becomes colleagues with Kyoko , before the entire editorial crew jumped upon the opportunity of scouting and reviewing various Udon shops , positioning themselves in time for the craze . My eyes were on the bowls of noodle , as well as the cute looking Manami Konishi , who had a bit part in Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Retribution , where she had pretty little to do . As the heroine in Udon , don't expect much too , but at least she plays the supportive friend , while being comic fodder in the first half . For those who prefer drama , the second half of Udon will be your cup of tea , as the movie shifts into lower gear to examine the love-hate ties between Kosuke and his dad , and would be chefs out there would want to pay attention here to pick up some secrets into preparing that perfect bowl of udon . Coupled with a bit of comedy and a snazzy CGI-ed sequence played totally for its cheese , director Katsuyuki Motohiro and writer Masashi Todayama seemed to have piled on too much for Udon , unlike their earlier work on the Bayside Shakedown movies , which had a lot going , but managed to pull it off because it still boiled down to cops solving crime , in a rather daily operational look at the police force from different perspectives of those on the beat , and those on the ivory tower . But similar to being spoilt for choice with udon being served and prepared in either hot in cold , hot in hot or just cold , Udon the movie couldn't decide what it wants to be - pseudo - documentary , comedy , family drama , romance , that while each serves its purpose , these ingredients don't manage to gel together to become a formidable dish . Watchable , but nothing too memorable .",317399,317399,True
90,"1944 ; the Nazis are sending V-2's ( flying bombs ) to London . These have an unnerving tendency to fall silent just before they hit , meaning that no-one in the capital can be sure exactly where they will next strike . This is an impressive opening indeed , and would have been even more so had it not been lifted wholesale from the middle section of ' Operation Crossbow ' , made by M . G . M . four years before . Those gallant lads of the R . A . F . ' Mosquito Squadron ' swing into action . Headed by the wonderfully-named Squadron Leader Quint Monroe ( David McCallum ) they bomb the launching pads . But a surprise Messerschmitt attack results in Monroe losing his best friend ' Scotty ' ( David Buck ) . The Squadron Leader is given the duty of imparting the bad news to Scotty's widow Beth ( Suzanne Neve ) . Not only is she beautiful but apparently telepathic - as soon as Quint approaches she bursts into tears and runs from the room , and he has not said a word ! She recovers and then both are are going for long drives in the country in his sporty red M . G . Though the V-2 launching pads are now gone , the crisis is not yet over as the Nazis are busy developing V-3 and V-4 rockets , using Chavron Château in France as a headquarters , and the Mosquitoes are given the job of bombing the place . Obviously those fellers at The War Office are huge ' Star Wars ' fans because their favoured method involves dropping a bouncing bomb ( based on an idea by Barnes Wallis ) down a narrow tunnel . With only nine days to go , Monroe and co . begin training . They are not very good though ( The Force is never around when you need it ) . Just as they get the hang of things , disaster strikes . German planes attack an airfield , dropping a box that turns out to contain a roll of film ( someone says ' its a roll of film ! ' which is helpful to those of us who have no idea what a roll of film looks like ) . On it is footage of British P . O . W . ' s , some from the Squadron itself . The Nazis have placed the men in close proximity to Chavron , hoping to use them as human shields . Particularly worrying for Monroe is the fact that Scotty is among them . . . ' Mosquito Squadron ' was originally conceived as a sequel to the popular ' 633 Squadron ' ( 1964 ) starring Cliff Robertson . Presumably this was changed out of reluctance on the part of Oakmont Productions to pay Frederick E . Smith royalties . Like that movie , it has a paper-thin plot , one-dimensional characters , repetitive battle scenes , and good music . Some of the shots in the film ( those not from ' Operation Crossbow ' ) came from that earlier picture . McCallum was a hot property then thanks to ' The Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' , but somehow his popularity never translated into bums on cinema seats . The director , the late Boris Sagal , directed several ' U . N . C . L . E . ' episodes . Not being an expert on W . W . 2 , I cannot say with absolute certainty that this is embarrassingly inaccurate , but we do not see David McCallum sending text messages to The War Office , and that's enough for me . What it has going for it are a refreshing lack of forced jingoism , and the absence of an American star in the lead . I note that some of the sniffy reviews to be found here are by Americans . I presume they are unused to watching a war movie in which one of their countrymen does not save the day . You can summarise the plot thus ; Blighty is in peril , only the Mosquitoes can save us , and , after a long struggle , they do . That's about it . Characterisation is virtually non-existent , and the Nazis are treated basically as machine gun fodder . But it affords the same pleasure as an old ' Hotspur ' Annual . Some great British actors decorate this epic - Charles Gray , Robert Urquhart , Dinsdale Landen , McCallum himself , Nicky Henson , and there's a fleeting glimpse of future ' Doctor In The House ' star George Layton ! If all you want from a war movie is entertainment , and aren't too bothered by whether it sticks to the facts , give this one a whirl . I would sooner watch it than sit through all three bum-numbing hours of ' Saving Private Spielberg ' ( or whatever its called ) again .","The U . S . theatrical release of this follow-up to the highly popular epic comedy THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES ( 1965 ) was decidedly ill-timed ? coming as it did just three days after that of MIDNIGHT COWBOY ! ? and must have made an already inferior product ( in comparison to the original ) seem quaint and redundant . Perhaps this even explains the film's hacking down to 93 minutes ( from an original length of 125 ! ) over there , not to mention its sheer invisibility on TV and home video ( in my neck of the woods at least ) until now , via Legend Films ' no-frills but full-length DVD ? albeit under its more recognizable alternate title rather than the original one of MONTE CARLO OR BUST ! Perhaps inevitably , several of the same cast and crew from the predecessor are involved here as well : producer-director-co-writer Annakin , screenwriter Jack Davies , composer Ron Goodwin , actors Terry-Thomas ( in a way , actually reprising his signature role by playing the son of the character he had portrayed in FLYING MACHINES ) , Eric Sykes ( again as the latter's valet ) and Gert Frobe ( as , obviously , the German representative ) , etc . Also like its prototype , several international stars were roped in to fill out the roles of the other contestants : from the USA , Tony Curtis ( who , sadly , is a long way from his winsome characterization in THE GREAT RACE [ 1965 ] ) ; from Britain , Peter Cook , Dudley Moore ( amusing as , respectively , an Army Major-cum-amateur inventor and his sidekick ) and , later , Susan Hampshire ( who initially tries to detour Curtis but eventually joins him ) ; from Italy , a level-headed Walter Chiari and a typically hot-blooded Lando Buzzanca ; from France , a group of three girls ( played by Mireille Darc , Marie Dubois and Nicoletta Macchiavelli ) who , prior to the start of the race , have a run-in with their compatriot organizer of the Monte Carlo Rally , Bourvil . There are other stars or recognizable faces making guest appearances for no real reason except to add to the fun ( and expense ) : Jack Hawkins and Derren Nesbitt ( as jewel thieves that have hid their booty inside one of Frobe's spare tyres ! ) , Hattie Jacques ( as an emancipated lady journalist ) , Richard Wattis and , according to the IMDb , even Paul Muller ( but I didn't recognize him ) . In this talented company and with the lavish budget accorded , there can't fail to be enjoyable stretches ( particularly with every new contraption Cook and Moore come up with after the last one had unsurprisingly failed ) and other sundry compensations ( not least Jimmy Durante's grizzled intonation of the title song and the accompanying animated credits sequence ) ; however , as I said earlier , the film is not up to the levels of inspiration that permeated its memorable predecessor . Tony Curtis only had one or two major films left before slipping into TV roles and the occasional big-screen cameo , while Annakin wouldn't really be allowed to handle another such stellar cast before a decade's time had elapsed ? including the umpteenth cinematic version of "" The Man In The Iron Mask "" in THE FIFTH MUSKETEER ( 1979 ) .",7743887,1399158,False
91,"Being a golfer and a fan of the sport for many years , I was very interested in seeing this , which I did when the VHS first came out . Later , I saw it again because of the same reason plus I usually find Glenn Ford's films entertaining . Well , the story moves well , it didn't bore me , but I did have problems with the accuracy of it and the general theme of the film , telling us that Hogan really was a nice guy who cared lot about what the public thought . From every account I have read , and from a couple of people who met him or knew him , that was not true . The fact is that he was a mean SOB and remained that way most of his life . This movie looks like it was made by his press agent . It's ridiculous and ruins what otherwise is an inspiring story . No one can deny Hogan's achievements on the links and his incredible desire to win against all odds . The fact he could come back and play after a near-fatal auto accident was amazing . . . . but I would not watch this again because it was too subjective and just not the truth .","Despite being fun to watch and very entertaining , this is not a film that draws me back for many viewings . Maybe it's too absurd : a beautiful woman pirate "" Morgan Adams "" ( Geena Davis ) punching everyone out at every turn can get a ridiculous and tiresome after awhile . It just an excess of everything , almost cartoon-like . If you haven't had enough action in first hour ( and you do ) , the last half really goes crazy with a non-stop battle scene that goes on and on and on . Nevertheless , there are some good things to watch in here besides Davis and her pretty face . the movie was filmed in Malta and in Thailand and features some beautiful island photography . The ship is magnificent and when two ships are side-by-side firing cannons at one another , it's an awesome sight and even more awesome sound . You really need to watch this with a good stereo system to appreciate the great audio work in here . Frank Langella also makes for an interestingly effective villain ( "" Dawg Brown "" ) while Matthew Modine ( "" William Shaw "" ) chips in with a co-star and male companion for the good guy , er good girl , Davis character .",4445210,4445210,True
92,"Gillian Holroyd ( Kim Novak ) is a witch . Secretly , she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson ( James Stewart ) . She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her . Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man . She decides to tell him her secret . But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was "" tricked "" into falling in love with Gillian ? As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go , Bell Book and Candle is good , but nothing spectacular . It's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it . Just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread . The movie's cute , funny at times , and touching in the end . Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry . Novak ( as others have pointed out ) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way . The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon , Hermione Gingold , and Elsa Lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart . The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be . Is it a screwball comedy ? Is it a romantic comedy ? Is it a supernatural comedy ? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach , the movie might have been even better and more memorable .","At first glance , the storyline looks like a distant cousin to the Japanese movie Battle Royale . Instead of having sent unruly students to an island and see them finish off one another , The Condemned follows the same lines of having 10 death row prisoners from around the world being brought to an island , and given a simple rule to kill everyone else in order to earn their survival , and freedom . They are similarly rigged with an explosive device which if tampered , or if they choose not to participate , they too will be blown to bits . But there's where the similarity stops . There's no PA system to tell the scattered involuntary participants just how many survivors there are ( thus leading to a loophole ) , and there are multiple camera rigs installed on the island , for the purpose of entertainment . The Condemned plays on some of our intrinsic nature of wanting to watch gladiatorial styled violence , and given that such content will probably never get on the TV networks , the fairly sci-fi turned reality TV over IP concept gets its airtime here . What networks refuse to screen and produce , you can , given the right equipment and personnel , and plenty of computing power . Pay-per-view IPTV using credit cards is the road to riches for the game producer Ian Breckel ( Robert Mammone ) , who champions the thought of producing content that audiences around the world want to watch . His argument was that these handpicked participants are going to die anyway , and here , he's giving one of them the chance to live , a noble gesture to him . The Condemned mocks today's reality TV format , in that sometimes , the game can be manipulated to satisfy the producers ' objectives , and we see that in abundance here . Violence it seems is high on the agenda here - how much can an audience stomach , especially if say hypothetically , Big Brother type of series allow violence to be met out live , unedited and raw . Or are you going to play to those who pay , and give in to the demand ? There's a constant argument being played out early in the movie about dignity and decency , but that gets forgotten fairly easily in a film like this one , falling victim to its own preachy statements . Especially so when Sports Entertainment companies like WWE are involved in this one . WWE had its fair share of stars lending their "" acting talent "" to Hollywood , and I can go as far back as the late Andre the Giant lending his physical presence in The Princess Bride . Then you have Hulk Hogan in various forgettable flicks , The Rock in some charismatic roles ( though some are as cheesy as that in Be Cool ) , and Kane in the horrid See No Evil . Here , Stone Cold Steve Austin plays the lead role of Jack Conrad , an inmate with an unspecified past , who becomes someone more than anyone had bargained for . But the star unfortunately is not Austin , as much as he plays the anti-hero . Vinny Jones , as British prisoner Ewan McStarley , clearly stole his thunder , and injected more personality into his maniacal character . While the format of the game had the prisoners from different parts of the world to allow everyone a chance to root for their home players , it was at times ironic that USA had to battle UK so prominently in the movie , and that the "" with me or against me "" line just brings to mind the many scenarios as played out ever so often . It's ra-ra for the USA in an in-your-face fashion , with eye-for-an-eye violence dished out for avenging the weak and wounded , and the showing of compassion to those who needs it . The make up of the team of pla yers too is interesting on purpose , with female players up against male ones ( and what happens is such an easy guess ) , and Survivor styled formation of alliances , outwitting , outlasting , outplaying all being key to survival , but the story , with so many characters , dictate that you cannot go beyond what is superficially shown . Of course the leads got a little more background to show for , but you find that these happen to be just cosmetics , unnecessarily inflating the screening duration . The Condemned tried to be a little deep , but ended up tossing its attempts aside to settle for an all out action movie towards the end , and what I thought was bordering on the ridiculous at Austin's ability . For action junkies , the sequences here might be a little repetitive with its usual big explosions , and the extreme closeups of violence using the shaky hand-held camera technique just irritates . If the premise still excites you after all the mentioned flaws , then The Condemned managed to appeal to you with its in-movie concept - I think you'll pay US $49 . 95 should there be a channel like this on the internet .",3109237,317399,False
93,"I honestly don't understand what all the fuss is about . Why do people hate Waterworld ? Why was it instantly disregarded before it was even released ? When you really think about it , how much different IS Waterworld from the more recent Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest ? They are quite similar if you think about it . Waterworld also cost $75 million less than DMC . But because it has Johnny Depp in mascara the whole world loves it ! Hypocrisy ! With a lot of behind the scenes trouble ( Reynolds walked off the film and Costner had to finish the final third of filming himself ) and negative pre-release buzz , everyone expected Waterworld to fail . Boasting a budget of £175 million ( the most expensive ever until Titanic 2 years later ) it was sure to be a flop , especially with the snooty public and critics blasting it before its release . Then , the unthinkable happened . Upon release , Waterworld actually managed to prove critic expectation wrong and be a good movie , receiving good ( albeit ignored ) reviews and finally earning a grand total of $255 million at the Box Office . This is before video , laserdisc , TV , DVD and HD-DVD sales . Does sound like a flop to you ? The plot is far-fetched . Yes , but so is a plot involving fish-men , giant squids and Orlando Bloom as anything remotely masculine . But you accepted that quite easily . So just , for a minute , believe that if the polar ice caps DID melt that the world WOULD be covered in water . Set hundreds of years after this particular cataclysm , Waterworld follows the journey of The Mariner ( Kevin Costner , who is only referred to a few times but never actually named ) , a man who is one step beyond human as he has the ability to breathe underwater and has webbed feet . Early on in the movie , The Mariner comes across an Atoll , a floating small town complete with its own hill . . . er Waterbillies . When the Atoll is seized by crazed madman baddie boss Dennis Hopper as The Duke of the Deez ( as in Exxon Valdeez ) , The Mariner escapes with Enola , a little girl who may hold the secret of Dryland and her guardian Helen ( the totally gorgeous Jeanne Tripplehorn ) . Not happy with anyone leaving the party The Duke sends his army of filthy smokers to catch The Mariner and discover Dryland for himself . Waterworld has a lot going for it . It's everything an action / sci-fi movie should be . There is so much escapism in the stunning seascapes and tropical feel . James Newton Howard's exotic score ( replacing a rejected score by Mark Isham ) is breathtaking and I seriously recommend you hunt down the soundtrack CD . The action is almost entirely special effects and stunt-work and it's brilliantly done . The editing is also quite impressive as is the amazing sound design . Waterworld is far superior to many , more expensive action films but still carries this burden of negative , unfair public opinion . I have only ever seen the 136-minute cut of Waterworld that was released into cinemas and subsequent VHS etc . But a Director's Cut of 176 minutes has been shown on TV in America several times . This version apparently restores several scenes that tie up loose ends and answers a lot of questions about how the this particular watery future works as well as revealing that Dryland is actually Mount Everest . Other than TV airings , this version has never made available to the public . Which is quite annoying as there is a huge fanbase for it . Don't have prejudices against this movie . Think different and see for yourself how cool it is .","Libraries and bookstores often put Hound of the Baskervilles in the horror section , well I never thought of the book to be exactly that . As Sherlock Holmes mysteries go , it was a long if nothing truly outstanding . There have been many movie interpretations over the years including Hammer horror versions , spoofs and multiple TV movies . There was even a silent version before this one , if my memory serves me correctly . So I guess it's one of the more famous of the original stories . Produced by 20th Century Fox , this was the first of 14 Holmes adventures to star Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce ( descendant of ' Robert The ' ) as Holmes and Watson . It stays fairly faithful to the book but misses out some of the meatier parts . Barrymore and his wife ( here called Barryman instead ) are no longer secretly brother and sister and the presence of the hound isn't as oppressive as it seemed in the novel . And it's obvious that the movie is clearly not really shot on Dartmoor but on a sound-stage in California . But it's none the worse for that . The studio setting actually lends a unique atmosphere to the gloomy Grimpen Mire and I especially like the dark and shadowy Baskerville Hall . I just wish more happened in and around it . The chemistry between Rathbone and Bruce here already seems to be perfect . Watson and Holmes have an original friendship and , as actors , they take advantage of that to accentuate their performances . I am aware that all Holmes / Watson combination of actors have done this over the years , but not as frequently as these two . A good timekiller , I just wish they made it longer .",102816,102816,True
94,"Knowing it wasn't really a horror film , I had missed out on this on Italian TV ; then , when it was released on PAL VHS , I kind of purchased it so as to go along with the other Lewtons that had been released up to that time . . . but , when I finally sat down to watch it , I was very much impressed with the film and was , naturally , surprised to find it so compelling - to say nothing of unusual ! In fact , the film is a delicate psychological fantasy largely seen from a child's viewpoint - and a highly original one at that . Kent Smith and Jane Randolph reprise their roles from CAT PEOPLE ( 1942 ) but take a back seat to their daughter ( Ann Carter ) - who , distressingly , is beginning to display some of the perplexing traits which had afflicted her father's tragic first wife ( Simone Simon - who also returns here , appearing as the child's imaginary friend ) ! The cast also highlights former Silent-screen star Julia Dean ( as an eccentric old lady whom Carter befriends ) and , also from CAT PEOPLE , Elizabeth Russell ( as Dean's long-suffering daughter , unrecognized by her dotty parent and understandably jealous of Carter's ' stolen ' affection ) ; Sir Lancelot also features as the sympathetic manservant in the Smith / Randolph household . Simon's mystical appearances are economically but effectively rendered by means of light and shadow ; despite her top-billing , she appears very little ( but , as was the case with Jean Brooks in THE SEVENTH VICTIM [ 1943 ] , her presence is felt constantly throughout ) and , unfortunately , seems to look down on the film as an unwarranted sequel mandated by the studio ( though it ended up being nothing like what they had expected ! ) - as opposed to CAT PEOPLE , for which she remained grateful to Lewton her entire life ! ! The latter , on the other hand , was more involved than on virtually any other of his films : the project was very personal to Lewton , being largely inspired by his own troubled childhood ( as well as the producer's love / hate relationship with his own daughter - who , eerily , died of her father's same ailment at the exact same age ! ) . The film was started by documentarist Gunther von Fritsch but his extremely slow progress saw him quickly ousted and replaced by former editor Robert Wise ; Lewton was evidently pleased with the end product ( though he continued to ache over the film's climax and eventually ordered a complete rewrite - the strain , however , landed the producer in hospital ! ) , and Wise was subsequently engaged to direct the period drama MADEMOISELLE FIFI ( 1944 ; also with Simone Simon ) and Lewton's next horror outing - and acknowledged masterpiece - THE BODY SNATCHER ( 1945 ) . The same comments I made in reference to the Greg Mank / Simone Simon Audio Commentary on CAT PEOPLE more or less apply to their second helping here .","before seeing the trailer for this movie , I , along with maybe a few others , thought this would be a sort of a continuation from Snyders re-make in 2004 . after ail , it has Rhames in this , and it's a remake of Romeros classic . how wrong i was . The only thing that this has in common with the original is the inclusion of Bud , which to be honest , is sacrilege . the infection ? oh , they begin to cough a bit and then the CGI hits them and they start to run around like drunk people trying to get to the kebab house before it closes . the story is puerile and the performances are pretty much the same . Suvari speaks and acts 2-dimensionally through the movie and as For Rhames , he barely utters a line before ' turning ' . there are some hideous stereo-types in the movie ( Salazar is the worst , what was Nick Cannon thinking ? ) and it all ends in a big CGI mess . if you are expecting anything like the original , or the re-make of Dawn Of The Dead , you are going to be sorely disappointed . oh , and it leaves the film , with a hint of a sequel . terrible",1399158,3717154,False
95,"Back when I was a kid in kindergarten , we always used to sing a song about a crocodile named Sophie and , according to the lyrics , her jaws were never closed because she always gossiped about the rest of the animal kingdom . Well now , the croc in "" Primeval "" answers to the name Gustave and his jaws are never closed neither , but for a completely different reason . Since the beginning of time , he reigns over the swamps & rivers in the poorest regions of Burundi and he supposedly devoured over 300 people already . Gustave normally just feeds on locals , so nobody in the Western world cares whether he lives or dies , but he now made the terrible mistake of eating a female white reporter and his quiet and peaceful days of over for good . A prominent American newspaper sends out an expedition , complete with reporters , local guides and a professional crocodile hunter , to capture Gustave alive . "" Primeval "" only just came out a couple of months ago , but it already earned itself a spot in IMDb's bottom 100 and receives one harshly negative review after the other . Quite undeservedly if you ask me , because it really isn't such a terrible movie and even benefices from a handful of good aspects , like a solid cast and engaging CGI-monster effects . The scriptwriters simply made one incomprehensible and unforgivable mistake ! Why on earth did John D . Brancato and Michael Ferris had the ambition to use the premise of a low-brained monster feature to alert us about the disastrous political situation in Southern Africa ? There's a 25-foot-long crocodile running amok and yet this movie mainly criticizes how the Western world shamelessly turned its back on the poverty & civil war issues in Burundi . If they wanted to make a harrowing and insightful follow-up to "" Hotel Rwanda "" that's perfect by me , but please don't pretend it's a non-stop gory and exciting creature-feature ! It's like the characters in the film say themselves : nobody cares about politics as long as there's a croc involved ! Mixing big-animal-horror with political drama topics , as well as the supposedly heart-breaking sub plot revolving on an African adolescent who'd do everything ( literally EVERYTHING ! ) to enter the USA , is probably Hollywood's worst spontaneous decision to date , and it's really no surprise the pubic hates this movie for it . If "" Primeval "" simply had focused on the bloody crocodile-hunting mission , everything would have been a-okay and it definitely would have ranked on the list of above average monster films . All the necessary ingredients and stereotype characters to make a delightfully cheesy and entertaining creature feature are present . The crew exists of a reluctant reporter who considers his trip to Burundi as a punishment for ruining a previous assignment , a new and ambitious female reporter who desperately wants to prove herself , the ' token-black-guy ' cameraman , the overly self-confident expert who thinks he's even better than Steve Irwin ( RIP ) and of course the introvert guide who has a personal score to settle with Gustave . Director Michael Katleman patiently waits a good 45 minutes before properly showing the crocodile ? and hence effectively builds up tension ? and it has to be said the animal looks very impressive . Gustave is big , but not over-the-top big , and he looks genuinely menacing when speeding through the swamps and destroying cages of solid steel . But then , completely out of the blue , the cameraman accidentally witnesses a political execution in the middle of nowhere and suddenly the Americans have to flee from local crime-networks instead of from Gustave . The sudden change in tone & message is impossible to cope with and the rest of the film is giant disaster . Not even the fairly spectacular finale can undo the damage . The cast is good , with Dominic Purcell ( "" Prison Break "" ) , Brooke Langton ( "" The Replacements "" ) , Orlando Jones ( "" Evolution "" ) and a typical supportive role for B-movie veteran Jürgen Prochnow .","This strangely offbeat and unusual late 80's slasher starts off vile and promisingly , but soon degenerates into a prototypically dumb and exaggeratedly implausible flick . Some people ? more specifically its very small but devoted fan base ? tend to describe "" Raging Fury "" as reminiscent to the gritty revenge-themed exploitation efforts of the late 70's , but I hardly see any connections . Nope , this is merely just another cheap and uninspired flick that actually insults the viewer's intelligence with all its impossibly far-fetched story twists . The highly entertaining opening sequences show a little girl "" accidentally "" killing a young biker couple in the swamp near her parental house because they destroyed her dolly . Enjoy this intro with its nasty make-up effects and glorious sleaze as much as you can , because it's all downhill from here ? 18 years later , the little girl ? Brooke Storm ? grew up to become a biology teacher in a standard American high school , but she obviously still suffers from a very unbalanced mental condition due to her traumatic childhood experience ( which makes you wonder how she ever managed to finish her own teaching studies ) . Elsewhere in the school , the popular jock all of a sudden decides it's time for a personality change and joins the school's gang of bad kids ( again , the most common thing in the world ) . As some sort of initiation rite for Jon-Jon , the clique decides to terrorize Miss Storm in her own house . They even set up a plan to frame the football team's quarterback in case anything goes wrong ! Needless to say the nightly attack causes Miss Storm to go totally bonkers again and the thugs get a whole lot more than they bargained for . "" Hell High "" is a bunch of senseless nonsense without tension or horrific atmosphere . The film only evokes unintentional laughs ( when the police actually do come to arrest the quarterback , my mates and I were laughing tears ) and sentiments of pity . Not surprisingly , the cast and crew list only exists out of nobodies . Director Douglas Grossman as well as most of the actors and actresses never worked on any other film again . Lead star Christopher Stryker even died of AIDS before the film's release . I know it's not a very nice thing to say but I doubt it was a big loss for the cinema industry .",2020269,2020269,True
96,"The Chase has one of the best casts ever assembled . At least three generations of Hollywood are represented here from Miriam Hopkins and Henry Hull , to Marlon Brando and Angie Dickinson , and finally to up and coming stars like Robert Redford and Jane Fonda . I'm still trying to figure what all the fuss was about . The film opens with the luckless Robert Redford escaping from a Texas prison with another convict who murders a passing motorist and then takes off stranding Redford . He's guilty even if he didn't do the actual killing . Poor Bob has no luck , his wife Jane Fonda is not staying faithful and true , but she's been carrying on with James Fox , the son of the local kingpin E . G . Marshall . Marlon Brando is the sheriff who people think takes his marching orders from Marshall . He'd like to bring in Redford alive , but for reasons I'm still trying to figure out , everybody has this real hatred for Redford and no one talks of anything else . It all ends rather badly for a few of the cast . Arthur Penn directed Lillian Hellman wrote the screenplay and with the cast they assembled you'd think something better would have emerged . Brando who sometimes is accused of mumbling his lines , does so with a vengeance and looks bored and the rest of the cast follows suit . I don't think Marlon Brando's most devoted fans would particularly like this one . Skip it by if it's broadcast unless you're a stargazer like me .","Since I was going through some of the low-brow Italian peplums of the 50s and 60s over the Easter period , I decided to watch this Silent epic ( also made in Italy ) simultaneously . However , it turned out to not really be a peplum after all ? despite the muscular title character ( protagonist of a long-running series of films and , here , somewhat incongruously sporting modern attire ? including a suit and tie ! ) and the fact that the Italians had actually pioneered the religious epic genre during the Silent era ! That said , I guess I should have known since I had already watched Riccardo Freda's colorful but disappointing 1962 semi-remake ( actually set against a 17th Century Puritan backdrop ) but , there at least , Maciste is still somehow fitted with the traditional loincloth ? Anyway , to get to the movie itself : since I hadn't previously watched any of the Silent Italian epics , I didn't quite know how well it would have worn the passage of time but , surprisingly , I was left reasonably impressed by the visual splendor of the production which often evoked medieval paintings ? particularly in its hellish sequences . In fact , as I watched the film , I was most reminded ? as had been another viewer writing on the IMDb ? of Benjamin Christensen's HAXAN ( 1922 ) and F . W . Murnau's FAUST ( 1926 ) which , I'm sure you'll agree , is high praise indeed for a film of this kind ! Besides , the human form taken by the devil Barbariccia ( literally "" Curlybeard "" ) and his minions evokes memories of Scapinelli , the Mephistophelean figure of "" The Student Of Prague "" ( a German folk-tale filmed twice , at least , during the Silent era ) ? The plot of the film proper ? Maciste is apparently a do-gooder whose activities are giving Hell a bad name , so a devil is sent to Earth in order to tempt him ; somehow , the former ends up in the underworld and , giving in to the affections of some devilish sirens , is himself turned into a hellish creature ? until saved by a child's prayer on Christmas Eve ! ? is quaint yet curiously effective , especially given the myriad unconvincing-looking demons Maciste has to face ; at one point , there's even a revolt ( never fully explained , at least in the 66-minute print I watched ) against Barbariccia's dominion in Hell ? which is an interesting way of saying that petty jealousies and machinations , the cause of so much evil on Earth , are present in the afterlife as well ! I don't recall the 1962 film enough to make comparisons , except to say that it was an unintentional laugh-riot , but also that the plot of the later version is quite different ? as it involves a reanimated witch who had been burned at the stake ( in fact , it was called THE WITCH'S CURSE in the U . S . ) ; I know , however , that I enjoyed the ' original ' a good deal and am certainly interested now in seeking out more Silent spectacles from Italy ?

In this installment , Pam's parents , the Byrnes ( Robert Deniro and Blythe Danner ) meet Greg's parent's , the Fockers ( Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand ) . the two families are like night and day , which should make for some hilarity , but fall a bit flat . there are some funny moments , just not as many as there could be , and this movie is not always entertaining . there are some spots that lag or scenes that could have been cut . the movie doesn't flow as smoothly as it should . The acting is fine . it is the material that is lackluster . i believe there are plans for a third installment . if so lets hope they iron out any bugs and maybe the third will be more on par with the first . this movie is average , but could have been so much more . out of 10","i had high hopes for two came back . obviously the ending is predictable , given the title . basically , a group of friends agree to sail a yacht for someone from san diego to vancouver . along the way , they get caught in a massive storm and all but two of them perish . the main focus of the story centres not so much on the storm , but its aftermath . the crew is left adrift in the middle of the ocean and struggle to survive , as they hope to be rescued . of course as days pass , each of them deals with their plight differently and eventually , when they are rescued there are only two remaining alive . that is the gist of the story . i thought it would be a better movie than it was , but it was mostly a bore . most of the actors weren't convincing . then again , they didn't have a lot to work with dialogue wise , so they can't be faulted entirely . the scenes of the storm were pretty exciting , but fairly brief . pre teens will probably enjoy this movie , but if you are in your mid teens and older , don't expect to be too entertained .",11423174,11423174,True

It looked like another corny slash and chatter bomb , but I wound up pretty much liking it . I don't consider it to be a really superb film , but I managed to stay interested all the way through . There was plenty of action , some romance , and quite a few laughs . I think that is what won me over : this picture is a comedy for the most part . A serious comedy .

But , while away in Tahiti on a job , he strikes a white man who insults him . He is instantly jailed - - it's forbidden for a native man to strike a white man . Nasty Gov Eugene De Laage ( Raymond Massey ) won't help him . He keeps trying to escape and that keeps extending his prison sentence . Will he ever get out and be reunited with Marama ? This film deals fairly realistically with racism ( it's against it of course ) but this is hardly a message movie . It's a big , silly but enjoyable piece of escapism . It looks great , there's a beautiful score and plenty of attractive shirtless men and women in sarongs . The script is merely serviceable but it does work - - I admit to getting misty-eyed once or twice ! John Ford directed this very well . Jon Hall is very handsome , nicely toned . . . and very bland as the lead . Lamour isn't much better . But their good looks ( and bodies ) make them pleasant to look at . Massey is just OK ; John Carradine is fun as an evil warden ; Thomas Mitchell is good ( and Oscar-nominated ) as a doctor and even Mary Astor has a few good moments . But the climatic hurricane sequence at the end really sells this . It has still impressive special effects and goes on for a good 15 minutes ! No music here - - just the sound of the wind howling and the waters crashing ( this won a well-deserved Oscar for Sound Effects ) . It's worth sitting through the movie for this one part .

99,"This was directed by Raoul Walsh and included many of the Warner Brothers stalwarts . You'll recognize many familiar faces if you're an aficionado of the genre . Rip-roaring , no-nonsense stuff , it's basically organized around three stories : ( 1 ) Cagney's rise from unemployed ex-soldier to the top of the bootlegger heap and back again ; ( 2 ) the love quadrangle involving Cagney , Gladys George as the soft-hearted blowzy Panama Smith , Priscilla Lane as the "" good girl "" , and Jeffrey Lynn as the lawyer ; and ( 3 ) the friendship of Cagney , Humphrey Bogart , and Jeffrey Lynn in the trenches , turning into a way partnership , the eventual defection of Lynn , the ruination of Cagney , and the death by natural causes ( three bullets ) of treacherous , greedy , petty Bogart . According to Mark Hellinger's story , the end of prohibition by Franklin Delano Roosevelt put an end to the gangsters . Zealous moralists , take note . The answer CAN be found in the bottom of a glass . As far as the movie is concerned , there's nothing much not to like . You may have seen it before , sections of it , in one guise or another . Citizen Kane boosted his girl friend's opera career , didn't he ? And as a matter of fact Cagney himself boosted Ruth Etting ( Doris Day ) in "" Love Me or Leave Me . "" And this was far from the first shootout Cagney had with treacherous ex-colleagues - - or the last , for that matter . But they're all stitched neatly together here . It should be seen if for no other reason than that it's an almost perfect exemplar of Warner's 1930s gangster movies . And it has a famous last line too - - "" He used to be a big shot , "" says Panama Smith over Cagney's corpse . Granted , it's not , "" Good-night , sweet prince , flights of angels sing thee to thy rest . "" It's a classic line only because Walsh's direction and Gladys George's reading make it so . I rather enjoyed it . There is Priscilla Lane's plain vanilla ice-cream beauty , Bogart's horrifying overacting when he's shot , Gladys George's softly knowing brittleness , Jeffrey Lynn's unimaginative , bourgeois impulses , and above all , James Cagney's acting . He's pretty good . And good at whatever emotional state he's projecting , from doomed resignation to cocky superiority . And he's outstanding after he falls from grace and winds up a seedy bum , haunting saloons and living in hovels that offer rooms for 15 cents a night . He realizes that his time has run out just as he's leaving Flannagan's Saloon , drunk , and for some reason he pauses at the piano on his way out , stares down at a half-empty glass of beer , and smiles to himself , both with sadness and relief . The shot is held for a while too . And it's not strictly functional - - a small but masterly gloss on Cagney's character development . Well worth seeing .","Frances Dee ( Mrs . Joel McRea ) , a Canadian nurse , takes a job on the small Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian . Her duty is to care for the wife ( Christine Gordon ) of the owner of the sugar plantation ( Tom Conway ) . Conway's brother ( James Ellison ) manages the place . Assorted characters are present , including Theresa Harris as the maid , Sir Lancelot as the calypso singer ( what else ? ) , and Darby Jones as the tallest , most bug-eyed shuffling zombie you ever saw . Conway's wife is in what appears to be a semi-coma . She mostly lies in bed , dressed in a flowing , translucent dressing gown , fully made up , looking glamorous . Sometimes she rises up and walks about with a vacant stare . Dr . Maxwell - - great name , there - - tells us that the condition is wholly medical , but others have different , more fanciful explanations . The maid believes Conway's wife is possessed by voodoo spirits and can only be cured by them . James Ellison blames himself . So does the mother of Ellison and Conway ( Edith Barrett , Mrs . Vincent Price ) . Conway blames himself and his family , who brought slavery to the island . The only guy who doesn't seem to blame himself or anybody else is Darby Jones , the speechless , pop-eyed zombie . The story ends tragically - - or , let's say , sadly - - but things are resolved and Tom Conway , who has fallen for Nurse Frances Dee , who has fallen for Tom Conway , is now free to marry her . Or him . That sentence was confusing . A couple of notes about what is really quite a fine picture made on Lewton's typical low budget . One is that James Ellison is the only person in the cast who can't act . He sounds like Robert Stack and moves like the Golem . Tom Conway is much better - - not just because of his suave British accent but because he shows some sensitivity to the role . The people of color are treated not with condescension but with ordinary dignity . Theresa Harris as the maid is particularly good . She smiles cheerfully and helps with moral problems as well as housekeeping . We ought to keep in mind that this movie was made during the same time period that African-Americans like Mantan Moreland and Willie Best were running around at other studies , their eyeballs bulging , exclaiming things like , "" Feets , don't fail me NOW ! "" But then Lewton and his director , Jacques Tourneur , treat everyone fairly in this film . There is no heavy . And the voodoo presentation is subdued . The up-tempo dance at the ceremony isn't too far from being accurate , some evidence of dance training aside . I won't get into it but voodoo ceremonies of today involve a lot of rum spitting and tobacco-smoke blowing and one or two cutting the heads off chickens to get blood . The dances are less restrained and sexier . Frances Dee is just fine in her role . She's so good looking - - petite and delicate and flouncy . The story , as has been noted , seems lifted from "" Jane Eyre , "" but there are also elements of "" Rebecca "" and even Henry James ' "" The Turn of the Screw . "" Nurse Dee , a beautiful young woman arrives on an island with evidently only two white guys , the brothers . One of them owns the place , is polite , protective , and distant , and somewhat mysteriously sad . The other brother just works on the plantation and is a resentful drunk . One wonders how long it took the nurse to figure out which one to aim for . The story is not the most finely tuned . At times it seems disjointed . I couldn't follow all of the events and don't know why some of them took place , except , in a few instances , to introduce a scare for the horror-movie audience . Each scene is packed with information but the place is a little slow . There are none of Lewton's famous "" buses "" , the nick name Lewton's unit at RKO gave to sudden moments of sheer fright . This is more spooky than shocking . I'm constantly amazed at how Lewton , an immigrant Russian with little background in films , could turn out so many carefully crafted movies with so little money , such filigreed minor masterpieces of mood , atmosphere , and character . The sets were mostly left-overs from earlier RKO productions , but so finely dressed that they seem to belong to his films alone . The photography and lighting are exemplary . The direction is original and tasteful . If "" I Walked With a Zombie "" were remade today ( and it might be ) , it would be full of ghastly close shots of horrifying zombie faces , munching human flesh , blood dripping down their jaws . This is one of many instances in which well enough should be left alone .",819382,819382,True

While not reading it cover to cover I did read about 100 pages in the middle section of the book just to see if it bore any resemblance to the TV-movie . Yes it does and no is doesn't . If that makes any sense . The characters are there and King's ever-recurring Derry is portrayed effectively enough as a dead-end , horrible town . But like most screen adaptations , it lacks the heavy substance of King's writing . But it would be hard to squeeze in over 1000 pages of story into a movie , even if it is 3 hours long . Split into two halves , the movie begins with the disappearance of a little girl , taken by an evil clown named Pennywise ( a deeply sinister Tim Curry ) . A local librarian recognizes the pattern of the murders and calls each of his friends ( The Lucky Seven / Losers Club ) who helped defeat Pennywise 30 years previously . Pennywise is not bound by the laws of physics and takes on the form of what each of the lucky seven are most afraid of . They find no other appropriate word to describe the phenomena other than IT . We see the backstory to each of them as they suddenly remember events they have mysteriously forgotten . A simple plot device , but effective . It makes the first half stronger than the second . From the 90-minute mark onwards we have a bunch of scared grown-ups who just seem to ask ' What are we going to do ? ' about a zillion times even though as kids they knew exactly what they were doing and were a lot tougher . The ultimate ending is a bit of a let down as it totally erases King's mythology and gives us some lame monster that is nothing compared to Pennywise himself . A helluva lot of King's mystery is simply torn out but IT still has enough energy and intrigue to make a decent stand-alone movie . But after 3 hours , I just wanted a better ending . Director Tommy Lee Wallace did want to shoot in Panavision ( an unusual move for a TV movie ) but the studio wouldn't allow him and so he compromised by shooting in flat 1 . 85 : 1 ( still irregular for 1990 ) . It would have been better to have a scope aspect ratio , especially with 7 characters sometimes occupying the screen at once . But you can blame studio interference for that . An above average TV movie , no doubt .

103,"Any way you look at it , Bound is a sex thriller . The story is very engaging and the direction is absolutely incredible , but the whole lesbian thing really overshadows all of that , which severely limits the impact that this movie could have had . Gina Gershon stars as a tough woman who falls in love with Jennifer Tilly , who happens to be the girlfriend of a gangster ( Joe Pantoliano ) . The two concoct a scheme to steal $2 million from the mob , and this story is presented very skillfully and interestingly . Ironically enough , you have to look past all of the lesbian action between Tilly and Gershon in order to really experience the skill that this movie is full of . Bound is Larry and Andy Wachowskis ' writing and directing debut , proving that they had the skills from the start . The style that made The Matrix so good can be seen in nearly every shot in this film , and this style is probably the best part of the whole movie . But the excellent directing wasn't the only thing that made Bound so good . This is an great gangster film , despite a few cheesy or flawed moments . For example , it was a little weird that the mobsters who came to Pantoliano's apartment - suspicious of the murder that had recently taken place which Pantoliano was desperately trying to cover up - didn't see their own bloody footprints on the carpet , or at least feel the blood squishing up through the carpet as they walked on it . But that's okay , because where else can you see $2 million hung up in an apartment on dozens of wires , drying after having blood washed off of it ? This is good stuff . Gershon and Tilly work perfectly on screen , and not just in the sex scenes . Their unique relationship was made interesting by their skillful acting , which was best when they were beginning to distrust each other . Hey , that's what happens when you put your life into the hands of someone you just met . Gershon , in particular , delivered an excellent performance , flawlessly bringing out her masculine side to play the strong role in her relationship with Tilly . There is something to be said about a sex thriller that is as good and as engaging as Bound , because they never really are any good , you know ? Don't be put off by this element of the film , because Bound is a trashy movie that definitely deserves your attention .","In preparing to watch the latest installment of the Rambo series , I've gone back and re - watched all of the original three films , which I hadn't seen in probably 15 years . Unfortunately , they are so uniformly bad that it has taken me now over a year to get through the three of them . I finished watching part III today and , like the two films before it , it was a notably underwhelming cinematic experience . By this point in the series , the Rambo formula is worked out in every detail . Rambo just wants to be left alone but then gets sucked into some brutally violent situation which , again , he has to take care of all on his own . He doesn't really play well with others , you see . Just as we found him languishing in a prison labor camp at the beginning of the second movie , Rambo is now living the dubious life of a monk in Thailand who takes breaks from the monastery to head into Bangkok and make some extra money in the stick-fighting competitions , which he promptly turns over to the monks to help build the monastery . He likes the feeling of belonging that he gets from living among the monks and doesn't want to be a soldier anymore . Needless to say , when the guys with the stripes on their shoulders approach and ask for his help , he's uninterested until a mission goes forward in Afghanistan and results in the good guy from the second movie getting taken prisoner , the first American ever taken prisoner in Afghanistan . And here , just like the last movie , is where everything starts to fall apart . The first American ever captured in Afghanistan is not an enviable position , to be sure , so it's easy to understand why Rambo would make such a sudden change of heart . What is unfortunately missing is the entire rest of the American military . I'm curious about how the real members of the United States military responded to the movie , which portrays them as either helpless or completely absent . It may be , perhaps , that the mission is thought to be a lost cause or not worth the risk , so sending Rambo in must , of course , be done "" unofficially . "" If Rambo is caught , he is told prior to embarking on the mission , the military will deny all knowledge of his existence , which prompts Rambo to sneer and say he's used to such treatment , and then do that thing where he ties his headband on all dramatically . At any rate , it's no surprise when Rambo insists that he has to do everything on his own . If you saw the level of sheer camp that the second movie reached then you know something of what to expect here , although it should be said that Rambo III is certainly better than First Blood Part II , which is undeniably the worst film of the already unimpressive series . It is definitely interesting , however , to watch the way the Afghani people are portrayed in the movie . Rambo enters Afghanistan alone and has to make his way to where the prisoner is being kept with only a single in-country contact , who tells him all about the cultural realities on the ground for the Afghani people . Alexander the Great tried and failed to conquer the Afghans , then the British , then the Americans , and they all failed . He explains to Rambo and ancient battle prayer written by a long-since defeated enemy - "" May God deliver us from the venom of the cobra , the teeth of the tiger , and the vengeance of the Afghan . "" The relationship between America and Afghanistan has changed drastically over the years , and not in a good way . In fact , given that we're at war in Afghanistan right now , this movie appears strangely prophetic . If George W . Bush had re-watched Rambo III somewhere around early 2003 , it would not be a stretch to think that the situation in the middle east might be drastically different right now . "" Every day your war machines lose ground to a bunch of poorly armed , poorly equipped freedom fighters . The fact is you underestimated your competition . If you'd studied your history you would know that these people have never given up to anyone . They'd rather die than be slaves to an invading army . You can't defeat a people like that ! "" Believe it or not , this is not a scathing criticism of America's current war in Afghanistan , it's a scathing criticism by the American prisoner of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the movie . It is one of the movie's strangest qualities that it pitts the Americans and the Afghans as allies against the cartoonishly villainous Soviets , who come in the form of wild-eyed lunatics at the controls of attack helicopters that buzz small villages laying waste unprovoked to whole populations of peaceful civilians . They are not just an invading force , they are airborne murderers that bombs women and children and disguise bombs as toys to trick unsuspecting children . With such enemies , it is understandable when one character ominously says , "" God would have mercy , Rambo won't . . . "" as Rambo sets off on his preposterous one-man mission of vengeance against the invading Soviets . It's interesting that the movie makes so much of how the Afghans have never given in to any invading force in their long history , and yet now they need Rambo to come in and save them from the Russians , but no matter . The movie was made to give the world another dose of outlandish Rambo-style retribution directed at the evil forces that be , and that's what it delivers . It's just too bad that Rambo-style retribution is generally so head-smackingly dumb .",562732,562732,True

It's the pinnacle for all future mobster movies - "" Godfather , "" "" Scarface "" ( the remake ) and even "" GoodFellas "" all borrow styles or concepts from this . The ending is eerily similar to Pacino in "" Scarface . "" Cagney stars as a mobster ( giving one of his snarling performances ) . The plot basically follows his rise and fall . Throughout , he has a strange fascination / obsession with his mother . He loves her more than his girlfriend . This is one element that really impressed me . For a film from 1949 it really handles some seedy elements rather well - this would still raise eyebrows if it were released over fifty years later ! Cagney is absolutely terrific . The film is a huge tour de force , breathtaking and mesmerizing . One of my favorite films , I would write more about the plot but I've found I always end up ruining the movie for people ! ( I have to restrain myself from referencing the ending ! ) If you like film noir , mobster movies or James Cagney ( or all of the above ! ) go buy this movie right now .","This is today's GV Surprise Screening . For their debut feature length film , directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris probably couldn't ask for a better script - Little Miss Sunshine is a comedic drama which has plenty of heart , even though the characters are misfits put together in a dysfunctional family . But wait , before you roll your eyes at yet another story with quirky characters , this one probably proved itself to be relatively superior given its easy going delivery , never taking itself too seriously with the messages it tried to put across , and the cast is a joy to behold . Telling the story of the Hoover family's journey cross-country to bring their young daughter to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant , it's an insane road trip movie as well in their yellow family mini-van . Abigail Breslin first made her debut in M Night Shyamalan's Signs as Mel Gibson's daughter , and here she's the wide-eyed adorable child who will just tug at your heartstrings - you'll probably be sympathizing with her character's ( mis ) fortune with a family like hers . But there's where the fun is , no ? The more recognizable actors here will be Steve Carrell ( The 40 Year Old Virgin ) , as her gay scholarly uncle , and Toni Collette ( In Her Shoes ) as her mom . Rounding up the cast are Greg Kinnear as motivational-inspirational speaker Dad , Paul Dano as her brother who had taken a vow of silence , and Alan Arkin as coke-sniffing , foul - mouthed grandfather who dotes on her . While the opening might take its time to set the scene , once the family gets together there's no holding back . The dialogues and interactions between characters are fast and snappy , and each character's given enough screen time to showcase their tribulations and respective resolution . Which I found to be deftly done both in script and direction . There was one major loophole spotted , but nothing to mar your enjoyment of the movie . What I totally liked about the movie , is by the end of it , there's this warm fuzzy feeling that you'll feel about the message brought across , that the strength of family lies in sticking together , and through that , any adversary can be defeated , any troubles overcome . Anything else doesn't matter so long as there's unity , and the movie shows this pretty nicely - the gem of self-discovery together , and the getting out of the rut with support from one another . The crowd favourite is definitely the finale , which will more than likely to blow you away as it comes rather unexpectedly , and raises a few eyebrows too . At the screening , almost everyone was clapping and cheering , and the last time I experienced that kind of joy , was in the finale of Kinky Boots , which on hindsight , is similar in the kind of feeling it evokes from you . Though I must add that it was kind of unnerving somewhat watching the young performers prance around with their fake plastic smiles , stiff hair and loads of makeup . In life there are winners and there are losers . Little Miss Sunshine , is definitely a winner . Go watch !",1173088,317399,False
105,"THE CURSE OF THE OMEN is not without interest . It revolves around the supposed curse of Richard Donner's 1976 movie THE OMEN . Bad things happened before during and after the production . However many of the bad things that happened can surely be put down to coincidence and many of these terrible things have a tenuous connection with the movie For example we're told how stuntman Terry Walsh was standing in for Gregory Peck in the graveyard scene where the character Robert Thorn is attacked by a pack of rottweilers . Apparently they injured Walsh quite badly when they bit through his protective clothing . But as any stuntman will tell you the most dangerous stunts always revolve around animals because they have a mind of their own and their behaviour is impossible to predict . I should also point out that I'm a DOCTOR WHO fan and Walsh appeared in a great number of walk on parts in the BBC show and I've read several interviews on his career and seeing THE CURSE OF THE OMEN was the first time I'd heard about this incident . Perhaps the incident with the devil dogs has been exaggerated ? The documentary also mentioned another stuntman who worked on THE OMEN and was later seriously injured while filming A BRIDGE TOO FAR in Holland . Easily explained when you realise that stunt men do a dangerous job . I'm sure that everyone who worked on THE OMEN injured themselves some time or another The vagueness as to what this "" curse "" might be is also brought into question when Richard Donner explains the hotel he was staying in London was bombed by the IRA and that no matter what the weather was like he would always check under his car to make sure terrorists hadn't left a nasty surprise for him . This is common sense since the IRA were engaged in a sustained bombing campaign of London in 1974-75 , but it should be pointed out that if THE OMEN was filmed in 1973 or 1977 or had been filmed in another city the production team wouldn't have been subjected to terrorist bombings . Whose fault was it the hotel got bombed ? Is it the fault of a movie or the fault of a terrorist cell ? There is another incident that would have been laughably tenuous it if wasn't so tragic . Remember that scene in the movie where a character's head is sliced off by a truck with sheets of glass ? Well the effects artist behind that sequence John Richardson was driving in Holland when he was involved in a car crash and his travelling companion was "" cut almost in half and died instantly "" the insinuation being that it was like the scene from the film and most chilling of all it happened near to the town of Ommen ( sic ) ! Again it happened during the production of A BRIDGE TOO FAR . Perhaps that film is jinxed ? Strangely enough I was surprised that no one mentioned the decapitation scene was set in Megiddo in Israel a place that saw a bus bombing that murdered 17 people in June 2002 with heads and limbs scattered all over a road . Do you understand what I'm talking about when I mention shoehorning ? Coincidentally the word Armageddon is derived from the place name Megiddo . Again I'm surprised this wasn't mentioned To be fair Richard Donner himself dismisses these and other incidents as merely coincidence and categorically states that he doesn't believe in curses and regardless of whether they believe in curses or not fans of the film will find this interesting since it goes into depth about the anecdotes behind the making of the film including one about the famous scene with the goldfish . It's certainly a thought provoking documentary and would make a great companion piece to the movie","Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known that I would have staked my life that the director was Brian DePalma . Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams "" Depalma , DePalma , Depalma "" Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans Hitchcock over the years Russell should have tried emulating a style of his own . Sure an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been bizarre with a capital B but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience . Stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market . Oh and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s . Yawn The only thing of any real note to CRIMES OF PASSION is the controversy it caused . I guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity , but as for the controversial sex scenes . . . What controversial sex scenes ?

Quickly the whole town falls apart - - relationships are destroyed , mistrust and suspicion are all over and it finally leads to suicide and a murder . Plotwise this may seem familiar to many but it's beautifully done . The film moves quickly , is well-acted and director Henri-Georges Clourot ( who also directed the classic "" Diabolique "" ) does a wonderful job of visualizing the paranoia and hatred of the townspeople . The best sequence has a nurse running away when she thinks she is being chased by a crowd . Also this deals with sex outside marriage , pregnancy and abortion - - taboo subject in 1943 . Believe it or not this was seen as Nazi propaganda in its day ! It was shot while France was being occupied and shows a town full of violent , suspicious and angry people . French people thought it was a slap in the face to them - - showing them as ignorant people who let lies destroy them . That seems pretty silly now . It's now rightfully regarded as a classic . Well worth catching . I give it a 10 .",463200,463200,True
116,"Dr . Strangelove is widely considered to be one of Stanley Kubrick's best films , if not THE best , and it's easy to see why . I remember watching it several years ago and not really getting into it , but as I rewatched it a couple nights ago I realized quickly what I had missed back then . It is a remarkably simple film , an actor's film , obviously , but the crackling dialogue and the stunning performances ( most notably from Peter Sellers and George C . Scott , of course ) , are what really make the movie work so well . That is , of course , a pretty powerful statement , to give so much credit to the actors , since the story itself is a compellingly realistic and plausible what-if tale that was released to the public in an atmosphere of frightening tension between the U . S . and Russia . So realistic , in fact , that they felt it necessary to including a disclaimer at the beginning of the film , in which the Air Force would like to assure the public that it has systems in place which would prevent such a thing from ever happening . The film begins with something that was news to me , that America kept a given number of B-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , in the event that their destructive services might be suddenly needed , which itself is a sign of what the times were like back then . The story concerns a General who loses his mind and orders all airborne bombers to attack Russia , unprovoked . The men on board the planes are dumbstruck , of course , because they realize the meaning of this order . A brilliant Slim Pickens is in charge on board one of the planes , and there is a rumor that during the performance , he wasn't told that the film was a comedy , which may be one of the reasons his comic performance is so brilliant , because this is exactly the kind of comedy that Kubrick loves and excels with . As Roger Ebert once noted , a man wearing a funny hat is not funny . But a man who doesn't KNOW he's wearing a funny hat . . . I have three favorite interactions in the film . The first is the isolated interaction between the crazy general and one of Sellers ' performances , Colonel Mandrake , who is stuck with the general and forced to listen with increasing agitation and disbelief to the general's explanations for why it is so imperative to strike the Russians immediately ( "" A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual ! "" ) . This is funny to me because I have a close friend who's wife is absolutely convinced that the American government is doing this to its own citizens right now as I write this , in early 2008 . She should watch this film . The second performance I love is Sellers ' portrayal of Dr . Strangelove , although I'll admit that I remain a little confused as to why the film ended with his sudden exclamation that he can walk . I know there is something going on there that I'm missing but I just can't think of it . And last but not least , George C . Scott as the fanatical General Buck Turgidson . Scott's performance is so brilliant and in such deep detail that it's impossible to see it all in one viewing . I rewound all of his scenes two or three times and there is always something new . I think his might be the best performance in the movie . Watch , of course , for a young James Earl Jones on board the airplane , and of course Pickens ' exit from the airplane and the movie , which is one of the most famous moments in film history . And of course , since in China I especially appreciated this - listen for Mandrake's hilarious comment about his experience being tortured by the Japanese ! Only Peter Sellers could make something as real and disturbing as Japanese torture this funny !","Christopher Lambert ; the king of newer B-movies . The guy has been in every ( I think ) Highlander movie so far , despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular . He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care , or if he really doesn't realize their quality ( or , rather , lack thereof ) . Here , he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick , Fortress . In the first one , the prison was huge , and underneath the ground . Here , it's . . . well , it's still huge , but this time , it's in outer space . I guess the writer thought , hey , the first time , it was underneath the ground . . . the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space . I hope he's right . . . I surely do , because if he is , maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this . Lambert portrays the exact same character , which I suppose is good , as he was a decent character in the first . A few somewhat big names also join the cast , most noticeably Pam Grier . The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade ( apart from Lambert himself ) , meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first ( anyone who knows how the first ended knows why ) . Unfortunately , that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead , rather than a sequel . The hacker from the first ( who was a neurotic , nervous guy , beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent , Jeffrey Combs ) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype . The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance ( which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well . . . odd . . . I don't remember that from the first . . . does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid ? Who'd do that ? ) , instead of his wife as it was in the first . . . apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character , without capturing the kid . The Men-Tel prison commander ( who was played by the cool bad-guy actor , Kurtwood Smith , from RoboCop fame ) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves ( as opposed to the cool Smith , who was a menacing and threatening presence ) . The plot is a rehash of the first . The pacing isn't particularly good . The very scenes in the movie seems to be ( for the most part ) remakes of the scenes of the original ( talk about lack of originality . . . ) and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first , just made a little less exciting ( remember those way-cool machine guns with three barrels in the first ? They're replaced with dull futuristic-looking stick-stun-guns ) . The special effects are decent at best . The script is a weak rehash of the first , with a few added sub-plots , none of which being particularly good . . . most of them are just there to keep the film going , or put it an action scene , in order to distract the audience from the poor writing . The dialog is pretty bad , with one or two exceptions . All in all , the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first was ( which isn't even a lot ) . Somebody took the first film , said , "" hey , this is popular . . . but it's not very good . . . how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it ? "" Probably writer / producer / actor John Flock , who , going by the plot and the writing of this film , really is as dumb as he looks . I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress , Lambert or B-movies . Everyone else ; don't bother . There's a million better ways to spend 90 minutes , and there's at least as many reasons not to see this film .",562732,2093818,False
117,"Although I did like the 1946 adaptation of the Killers , I wasn't sure how a Russian , let alone someone who is usually much more into the visual prowess of things like Andrei Tarkovsky , would tackle Ernest Hemingway's brief , pulpy story of men on a mission and a man in hiding from those men . Turns out it's one of the best short films I've seen from a soon-to-be world renown European auteur , because of it's emphasis on the simplicity of suspense , of human action in desperate circumstances and how it's filmed with a mix of the noir style and with Tarkovsky's dependence on figures in curiously exciting compositions . He isn't alone on the film , however , as the middle scene at the apartment was directed by friend Alexander Gordon , with Tarkovsky directing the bigger chunks at the diner , and another guy Marika Beiku co-directing overall . Since the apartment scene is so short though , and accounts for just three shots , one being most elaborate as it goes in and out , tight and wide , on the morose Swede in hiding and his friend at the diner filling him in on what happened , it's mostly Tarkovsky's game here . Part of the skill , and curiosity , in how tense the long first scene at the diner is that music is completely absent , with the only tone coming from Tarkovsky himself as a whistling customer . Meanwhile , Tarkovsky uses Hemingway's dialog in a very realistic manner , even when he goes deliberate angles , like when George goes into the back with the sandwiches and we see his feet in the same tilted frame as an empty can on the floor , or with the usage of the mirror on the wall . There's also the suddenness of seeing a machine gun that strikes things up in the room , and just the general attitude of Al and Max , the hit men , as they keep calling George "" bright boy "" in a way that reminds me of the curious double-talk in a self-consciously bad-ass movie like Pulp Fiction ( not to mention the near casual usage of the ' N ' bomb ) . While it ends sort of on a screeching halt , the sense of ambiguity as to the fate of the Swede as well as everyone else in the diner who hid the secret is worthwhile for the material , as it's perfectly anti-climactic . It's not entirely a simple experiment , as it's too polished for that , but I couldn't see how it could be made any longer either . It's perfectly paced and acted nearly as well , and it's a fitting pre-cursor to the un-prolific but remarkable career of one of Russia's most important filmmakers .","Lasse Halstrom isn't out , as a film-making , to make really extreme and probing insights into what goes into a prankster / forger like Clifford Irving . Maybe it's because he , like I , saw Orson Welles's film F For Fake , which covered similar ground and has the only substantial footage of Clifford Irving on record and in full bloom with his BS meter going sky-high . That film , overall , dug very deep into what is to have forgery , a hoax , as part of personality . Halstrom doesn't quite get that , but nevertheless he's made an entertaining mini-saga of a man - or rather men in this case - who went to the edge of credibility and almost got away with the whole shebang . His story , as covered as well in part in F for Fake , is about Irving's incredibly smart and incredibly stupid attempt at passing off as his own the autobiography of Howard Hughes , then the notoriously reclusive and nutty billionaire with his fingers in enterprises all over the world . He passes off Hughes's handwriting to the publishers and lawyers as his , even as it's really Irving who wrote it all , and even went so far as to have mock audio recordings of Irving AS Hughes to get down in the book via assistant Dick Suskind . As the walls seem to be closing in on their scam , as well as Irving's marriage , it goes as far as mass printings of the book Irving presents - until the ' real ' Hughes makes a press conference call ( call , of course ) , to disprove the book altogether as a hoax . Halstrom surprisingly makes his film light and dark in tone , depending on what stage the story is in , and it's even fun at times to see Irving and Suskind go about their risk-taking maneuvers to get all documents and information they can on Hughes , as if it's guerrilla research . Then as the despair of constant lying increases , and the threat of capture and revelation is nearer , Halstrom makes it more like a paranoid thriller . This latter part may actually be not quite as convincing - so to speak of course , as one can't be sure entirely what's true or not in The Hoax - because , simply , one might not see Irving so much as a crazy person ala Hughes so much as a kind of strange artist-cum-professional at what he does : to make himself believe the BS before he even feeds it to others . Scenes like Irving getting caught by Hughes's "" secret agents "" in the middle of the night are not as striking as Halstrom might have intended , even as all the while the performances are still good . And the realm of placing the story in context of the times is hit or miss ; it works , to be sure , when going into the Nixon administration sections because it's crucial to the story ( and , according to some articles on the film , is possibly really accurate ) , though putting in the footage of Vietnam and protesters and so forth are sort of padding to environment and period . The music , costumes , locations ( i . e . Las Vegas ) and simple political ramifications make it enough . This being said , The Hoax provides the audience with some very effective performances . Gere , under the right director , can be terrific , and this is one of his best performances in years , as he balances out Irving's higher aspirations of wealth and notoriety with his latter plunge into confusing his own personality with that of Hughes , with suspicions of everything or anyone around him . The filmmakers wisely don't make Irving very sympathetic , and Gere plays this for all it's worth with moments of charm , tension , and delusions of grandeur played out wonderfully . However , if Gere is good , Alfred Molina is better as Suskind , Irving's collaborator and the real behind-the-scenes guy who helps make Irving's fabrications all the more palatable , like hiding documents out of the Pentagon or flying to another country to mail an envelope . Suskind , unlike Irving , ends up dealing with the hoax with more of a psychological / moral burden , and it ends up weighing on his conscience like a brick . It might make Suskind the more conventional character in the movie , but Molina makes him very real and more of the tragic case than Gere's Irving . Molina's track record , at the least , remains untarnished . Other supporting players like Marcia Hay Harden , Julie Delpy , Eli Wallach , and Stanley Tucci are better than average here . The Hoax is a good treat in this month's lot of schlock and big-budget trash by sticking close to making it an actor's movie , and sort of a bittersweet take on what a hoax does in such a grand scale as that of Howard Hughes , and what it does to a person the longer and more intense it goes on for .",453068,453068,True
118,"Okay , put aside the vampires , werewolves , Godzillas and masked serial killers for a while ? . What we have here is an entirely new breed of horror species . The Sleepwalkers , as based on Stephen King's unpublished story , are reptile-like creatures that feed on the vitality of young virgins . Charles Brady and his foxy mother are the last of their kind and have a torrid incestuous relationship . But in order not to become extinct , Charles needs to seduce the cute Mädchen Amick so he can suck her dry and pass the energy on to his mum . Pretty far-fetched , isn't it ? That's exactly the problem with the whole movie . It tries to be something completely new and inventive but the story fails to give a proper background to these ? basically interesting ? creatures . Why are they called Sleepwalkers ? Why virgins exclusively ? What's their origin and how come they're as good as extinct ? How come they have the ability to appear invisible and ? most importantly ? why are ordinary cats their biggest threat ? If you don't bother about the constant illogicalness and major plot holes , you'll sure be entertained . ' Sleepwalkers ' contains tons of gore ( especially near the end when it's a total cop-massacre ) and the silly humor . It's pretty amusing to see a chubby cop getting stabbed by a corncob ! ' Cop-Kebab ! ! ! ! ! ' Yet , it has to be said , in between the badness , Sleepwalkers does feature some terrific elements and a few highly entertaining trivia-aspects . The beautiful songs ' Boadiccea ' by Enya is one of the best sounds ever featuring in a horror movie . And the film is stuffed with fun cameos of other horror directors like Clive Barker , Tobe Hooper , Joe Dante and John Landis . Stephen King himself shortly appears as the cemetery caretaker . The best advice I can give you when watching this film : Switch your brain to ' off ' and have fun .","There has been so much written on Saw since its release in 2004 that I doubt there's much left to be said . Therefore , I'll limit this to just a couple of comments . It may not be the best "" new "" horror film I've seen , but it certainly beats a lot of the post-Scream films that glutted the market in recent years . Saw features something sadly lacking from a lot of modern horror ? actual dialogue . Too many of the recent horror movies rely so heavily on larger-than-life CGI effects that dialogue is often an afterthought . It was a welcome change to see a film where characters have actual verbal interaction with one another . Even though the movie is heavily dependent on two characters speaking to each other , there are still enough gruesome scenes to spice things up . They are shocking in their nature and difficult to watch in their viciousness . These scenes are very well done . My biggest complaint ( and I'll try not to reveal too much and spoil the film as it was spoiled for me ) is the big twist at the end . I just don't see how it's possible for "" that "" to have occurred . It doesn't seem feasible to me given the time frame of the events in Saw .",2020269,3109237,False
119,"The block Hollywood has been going through for several years must be big enough to prompt producers to produce remakes of successful films and "" the Omen "" is one of them . This remake opened on the 06th June 2006 , a beautiful date to serve the publicity campaign to promote the film . By the way , what's its contents worth ? I'll be frank and say that it's a well-crafted but lackluster menu for it contents itself to take literally virtually all the sequences of Richard Donner's opus and to reproduce without trying to bring something new or novel the different steps of the story . However , there's one major difference with its elder brother and it is to be found at the very beginning . The scenes in Rome at the Vatican weren't included in the 1976 movie . Otherwise it's the same draft-proof universe with , however some little modifications . In Donner's film , in one sequence Damien's mother was irritated by the noises her son made with billiards balls . In Moore's effort because of the modernity of the habits video games superseded these balls . That said , Moore succeeds better than Donner to build a latent and lasting tension to the audience and to ensure her a good dose of shivers and it often works . The best sequence would probably be the death of Damien's mother in alternate editing with Damien staring at a cop who's sweating . But the cast is patchy . Liev Schreiber was a better choice than Gregory Peck as the lead because he's younger . But Julia Stiles can't match Lee Remick . Ditto for David Thewlis who isn't as good as David Warner . As for Pete Postlethwaite , he was far better and disquieting in Bryan Singer's brilliant "" the Usual Suspects "" ( 1995 ) . But Mia Farrow as the housekeeper gets the lion's share and I can't help but smiling when I think about her real function in this remake : she has to defend Damien and so Satan whereas in "" Rosemary's Baby "" ( 1968 ) , she struggled against him . This remake of a good fantastic film doesn't certainly deserve to be disowned and the movie buffs who gave thumbs up to Donner's flick might be curious to have a look at it even if they know where they stand with it . Anyway , this remake of a fantastic film dealing with Satan is preferable to another lousy fantastic film on the same topic . See "" End of Days "" ( 1999 ) or "" Lost Souls "" ( 2000 ) . By the way , the little Harvey Stephens who held Damien's role in 1976 has a cameo as a journalist here .","Les Thibault  has been my bedside book for so many years ! I've read it so many times I can recite some of its lines by heart ! And it's an eight-volume 2 , 000 pages work ! A first miniseries was made in 1972 where Charles Vanel ( "" Salaire de la Peur "" "" Diabolique "" ) was an impressive Père Thibault . To people who have not read the book : you'd better see that version which is much closer to Martin du Gard's spirit . The 2003 one was freely adapted from the 1937 Noble PRIZE winner's work and they mean freely ! One should note that the actors are generally well chosen : despite all that has been said , the late Jean Yanne was not perhaps the right Père Thibault : his vulgarity which made wonders in Chabrol's great films ( "" le Boucher "" "" Que la Bête meure "" ) is sometimes embarrassing for a man who was finally a bourgeois religious ( just for show ) man . On the other hand , Jean-Pierre Lorit and above all Malik Zidi shine in their sons ' parts . Zidi outshines François Dunoyer who played Jacques's part in 1972 . The rest of the cast is uniformly good with the exception of Julie Delarme : Jenny de Fontanin was a secret sexually repressed young girl ( she could not stand being touched ! ) . Her evolution was very slow from a childhood between a mother steeped in piety and a flighty father to a strange maturity made of her love for Jacques and a burgeoning activism . It was not the actress's fault but the writers ' anyway . One of the biggest flaw of the miniseries is some lines of the dialog . Jacques , Daniel , Antoine and particularly Meynestrel do not speak like young men from the pre-WW1 days . They speak like today's youth , they talk of sex like today's youth , and even the father Thibault utters the word "" baisable "" ( = f . . . . . . able ) . Martin du Gard would turn in his grave ! EPISODE 1 : it consists of the two first volumes "" le Cahier Gris "" and "" Le Pénitencier "" . By and large , it's probably the most satisfying one for it does not wander too much from its model . Daniel's and Jacques's running away is tastefully rendered , even if the script insists on the scene with the prostitute whereas Martin Du Gard treated it very quickly . The reform school scenes are generally good , but it was hard to make us feel Jacques ' s humiliation and the director only partially succeeds . In spite of an occasional gaffe ( Antoine asks Lisbeth to take away his brother's innocence ) , this episode is coherent and promises great things . EPISODE 2 : it consists of the third volume "" la Belle Saison "" . Ruling out the Packmell nightclub scenes is a good thing for it's probably the worst moment of the whole novel . Instead , the director focuses on Maisons-Laffite where the two families ( Thibault and Fontanin ) are neighbors . The stand-out of this second episode is arguably Amira Casar as Rachel , Antoine's one and only love . The actress is sensual , free , and beautiful and her portrayal is impressive even if , in the novel , Rachel never asked Antoine to introduce her to his father . Amira Casar outshines all the other actresses and however there are plenty of them . Florence Pernell is physically Madame de Fontanin , but it's a one-dimensional character , ; it's not the thespian's fault though : the lady was a strong believer , her faith was her way to cope with her husband's inconstancy . On the screen her motives do not make much sense . On the other hand , Malik Zidi's rebellion against his father is pure Thibault spirit . The scene does not exist in the book ( but told in Jacques's short story "" la Sorellina "" but the scenarists did a good job here . EPISODE 3 : although called "" death of the father "" , the screenplay combines this volume with the beginning of "" Summer 14 "" ( Oscar Thibault actually died circa 1910 ) , while incorporating elements taken from volumes which were not treated ( "" la Consultation "" "" la Sorellina "" ) It was not a bad idea either on account of the length of the book . Jean Yanne portrays a dying man with talent - sadly he was to die soon after , which makes these scenes even more moving - . One should note that the scenarists made Oscar Thibault more human ( call me "" papa "" , why not after all ? ) . Jacques Thibault seems very close to historical character pacifist Jean Jaurès , which he was not in the book , but it's not a big problem . EPISODE 4 : the weakest , by far . There are two good things : Jacques and Jenny , in a Paris ready for war - although their adventures were more convincing in the 1972 version - and the exceptional ten-minute performance of Lorit as a terminally-ill Antoine . As for the rest . . . The script becomes melodramatic and drastically wanders from the book ! Some characters turn up at the most awkward moments : Rachel ( who has also a scene in episode 3 ) comes back for a three-minute scene which does not bring anything to the plot ( s ) . When she is importuned by soldiers while leaving the railway station , Jenny finds brother Daniel to help her get rid of them . But Jacques's death takes the biscuit : not only he did not want to sacrifice his life ( at the end of "" Summer 1914 "" , the young brother Thibault is a broken disillusioned man who knows quite well that his desperate flight will be his last ) but it's Meynestrel who causes his death by committing suicide ! But the best is yet to come : as Jacques is dying , the nurse who finds him is none other than Lisbeth ! ( see episode 1 ) Enough is enough ! Only 12 minutes are given over to the admirable "" epilogue "" , a 300 pages volume , a strong meditation on life and death . Again , hats off to Jean-Pierre Lorit who manages to display every nuance of Antoine's desperation : he is to be commended , considering the limitations he is working under . A voice-over tells us about Jacques's son "" fate "" . Martin du Gard wanted to write his story but he gave up his plan circa 1930 , so Jean-Paul's "" story "" is the scenarists ' invention . It's certainly above-average TV stuff . But I strongly urge the users to read the books !",1219578,1219578,True

S . screens , and audiences took to JAMES MASON as the overly possessive guardian of ANN TODD , even though the character he played had some very unpleasant traits - - such as using his cane on the woman's fingers when a burst of temper had him out of control . It's the odd love / hate relationship between Mason and Todd that carries the film . Unfortunately , it carries it into the realm of theatricality when the relationship is shown at its most troubled stages . The film begins with the young woman attempting suicide from a bridge , and then the film becomes a study in psychological terms about the reason for her aversion to the piano with flashbacks serving as the means to unravel the cause of her illness . Some of it is very effective and certainly it's the reason JAMES MASON was discovered by Hollywood - - but it has to be viewed in the context of the time when psychology was being explored by both British and Hollywood filmmakers and audiences apparently embraced such stories . Mason's effectiveness in what could have been a highly unsympathetic role is what makes the film superior . Todd , while excellent at appearing to be a concert pianist , is less successful as a dramatic actress . A stronger performer in her role might have made the film more convincing than it is - - particularly in making the sappy ending more convincing .

Filled with lots of interesting characters like Banjo ( William Berger ) , Carrincha ( Ignazio Spalla ) , and Indio ( Aldo Canti ) ; more than a few laughs ; and some amazing tricks and gun play by Van Cleef ; it is just the thing for fans of the genre .

I do have to admit that the finale , when Godzilla destroyed Space Godzilla , was spectacular and one of the best fireworks displays I have seen . The ending was sorta cheesy as Godzilla calmly reenters the sea to some romantic music and a setting sun , as two of the G-Force team walk along the beach holding hand and whispering sweet nothings .

124,"Sunday , September 17 , 2006 marked the last broadcast of the WB . It was marked by airing the pilots of the following classics : Felicity , Angel , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and Dawson's Creek . Buffy the Vampire Slayer was originally a movie from 1992 starring Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry . That movie's writer , Joss Whedon , wasn't satisfied with the final result so he tried again with a TV series with himself as executive producer . Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) moves to Sunnydale from L . A . with her mother ( Kristine Sutherland ) , having been kicked out of her last high school . There she's befriended by Cordelia Chase ( Chrisma Carpenter ) who tries to introduce Buffy to her clique . But Buffy takes more of a shine to shy Willow ( Alyson Hannigan ) and her friends Xander ( Nicholas Brendan ) and Jesse ( Eric Balfour ) . As she enters the school library , she encounters a bespectacled man with a British accent named Rupert Giles ( Anthony Stewart Head ) who knows Buffy's a slayer and identifies himself as her watcher . Buffy really just wants a normal life . Giles explains what his and her duties are . Meanwhile , a dead body appears in a girl's locker . . . Very good first episode of what would be an outstanding series . Gellar , Hannigan , Brendan , and Head already make a fine team with Carpenter perfect as the stuck-up one . Also making first appearances are Angel ( David Boreanaz ) who is not yet identified as a vampire and Darla ( Julie Benz ) , not yet known as Angel's former lover . This was the first WB show that truly gave the network an identity as the one that teens could relate to . So it's fitting that it should air on the WB's last day . So long , WB .

Also the song - - "" Save the Earth "" BLEEECCCHHHH ! I don't know what the lyrics were in Japanese , but the English ones are downright insulting - - it's enough to make you cheer on Hedora .

125,"What can I say that hasn't been said by others who have come across this essential document of the survivors of the holocaust ? It goes beyond any kind of rating ; watching the people on screen tell their stories , and re-connect with their haunted roots , is about as captivating as it can get , genuinely so , enough to not want to look away . The stories from the five survivors is just enough to make it a crucial piece of history , of something that will survive past their years as their own talked-of memories of what they saw , the people they saw murdered including their families , of being stripped of humanity and more deeply for their souls . The actual footage of almost ten years ago of inside camps of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen is equally powerful to see . But it's another that other interviews are included with the likes of an ex-Auschwitz Nazi doctor who didn't go along with his other sadistic colleagues ; the American soldiers who were appalled to discover what they thought contained German prisoners of war to be thousands of Jews ; the one US Congressman ( at the time ) to survive the holocaust . The history of this period of the early to mid 40's has become abstracted in the view of society , something so enormous it's even more staggering that similar practices go on in other countries today . The notes of what Hitler did is given notice in the film , but the facts are more as a back-drop for what the Last Days focus is . By director James Moll going in for these women's stories , of what they lost and tried to regain , is just as important to see in its own light as Schindler's List as a dramatization of the facts . It's not too much a wonder it got the best documentary prize at the Oscars . Executive produced by Steven Spielberg ( speaking of ' Schindler ' ) and the Shoa foundation .","Sam Peckinpah proves his worth as a great director from the second half of the 20th century with The Wild Bunch , a film that breathes life as one of the 60's best , a blockbuster caliber picture that gives its audience what it wants - a cast of famous old-timers and some newcomers as well ( lest not forget Ernest Borgnine ) set the stage for the tale of robbers and killers in 1913 who want a large final score after getting screwed over , even as bounty hunters follow ominously . Even the slower moments are elegantly staged ; there is always something to look for on the screen and Peckinpah brings the violence so thick that while it doesn't compare to today's big-budgeters , has all the reality in girth . The characters are generally well-rounded , the suspense fierce , and the violence is handled with the same kind of precision as the ones with just straight-on dialog . Masterfully directed and acted with the great flair of old-school character acting , The Wild Bunch is a brash , essential Western that's a worthy watch for the fans from when it was released and people from later generations as well .",453068,453068,True
126,"Room At The Top filmed in 1959 takes place some ten years earlier in post war Great Britain as veteran Laurence Harvey takes it in his mind to rise from his lower class origins by any means possible . He's a devilishly attractive fellow and if that's what it takes to do it , than so be it . Not like it hasn't been done before on either side of the pond . Harvey's got no family so to speak , his parents were killed in his small town when a German bomb hit their house . He's rootless now and has a crying need to belong somewhere . The similarities in character to novelist John Braine's Joe Lampton and Theodore Dreiser's George Eastman are too obvious to overlook . However unlike Eastman , Lampton as played by Harvey is courting two very different kinds of women . Boss Donald Wolfit's daughter Heather Sears is a young and somewhat inexperienced young lady who's easy prey for Harvey . Wolfit and his wife Ambrosine Phillpotts see what's happening with their daughter , but can't ultimately do anything . But while they're trying Harvey falls in with the unhappily married Simone Signoret . She's married to Allan Cuthbertson who's a cheating dog himself . She's got a lot of passion left in her and even though Harvey's ten years younger , she knows how to show him one real good time . Being French she has a different moral view of things than the folks of her adopted country and she thinks Harvey does as well . He does , but Harvey has his priorities . Room At The Top was something that still couldn't be made in America because of the Code , but at least it was shown here . What Makes Sammy Run , a work by Budd Schulberg never had a big screen adaption and it had similar themes to Room At The Top , Still it got great critical acclaim and two Academy Awards and other nominations . Simone Signoret got one of those Oscars , for Best Actress in 1959 . It's a very subtle part she undertakes , in fact she's not the main character , Harvey is . Still when she's on the screen even Harvey's flashier character of Joe Lampton takes a back seat . Signoret is just fabulous as the older and still attractive woman , trapped in a loveless marriage will touch you dearly . She's one of the most beautiful and tragic figures ever done on screen . Harvey was up for Best Actor , but he and the film itself were running in the year of Ben-Hur . He and the picture itself lost to Charlton Heston and the noble character he created on screen . Hermione Baddely who had a role similar to Thelma Ritter's in All About Eve was up for Best Supporting Actress , but she lost to Shelley Winters for The Diary Of Anne Frank . Room At The Top with its brutally frank talk of sex mixed with ambition has become a classic and Joe Lampton became Laurence Harvey's signature role . Two sequels with Joe Lampton , Life At The Top and Man At the Top , were spawned from the original , the latter with Lampton played by Kenneth Haigh as Harvey had died by then . It's an enduring classic of the British , nay the English language cinema and should not be missed .","Adaptation of a play . A pre-stardom Kevin Bacon plays a sleazy , grimy , gay prostitute . He offers an older trick ( Orson Bean ) a young gay man . The problem is the kid dies and Bean is on the way . What to do ? I never saw the play but it can't be as dull as this . The acting here is good - - Bacon looks terrible ( as he should ) and Bean tears the scenery , and the plot is interesting . . . but this is just boring ! People just stand around and talk , talk , talk endlessly . I looked at my watch more than once . And seeing the nude , dead body of a young kid constantly during the second act is disturbing . Director Paul Morrissey does try different things to liven this up . There's a break in between where the two acts took place on stage ( the screen stayed black for a minute or two and the last section is shot in split screen . It's interesting but Morrissey doesn't seem to know how to USE split screen ( like Brian DePalma does ) and it ends up not adding anything to the movie . However there is one very funny sequence when the hustlers argue on how to use the NYC subway . It's too bad the script didn't match up with the acting . Worth seeing to see Bacon play a totally amoral , sleazy hustler . Also Esai Morales ( ! ! ! ) is the cast . This is probably his first film .",2483625,463200,False

James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's . Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows . This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs . Joan Blondell , ( Nan Prescott ) gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty . Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career .

Lots of nice Mexico scenery added much to the long , dusty hunt for the escapees .","Michele Soavi , understudy of horror maestro ; Dario Argento , has began to make a name for himself in the horror genre . His films aren't usually as good as the majority of Argento's repertoire ( with the exception of the phenomenal "" Dellamorte Dellamore "" ) , but they're usually good examples of modern Italian horror film making . The Church , however , isn't . That's not to say that The Church is a bad film , it's just very lacking . Unlike in The Sect , the mystery presented in The Church isn't interesting and doesn't provoke a need to know in the viewer ; unlike Stage Fright , the effects here are very bad . Obviously they're of a different ilk but that doesn't change the fact that the creature effects here are laughable and not believable in the slightest , which really harms the power of the movie and ; unlike Soavi's masterpiece Dellamorte Dellamore , The Church totally lacks character . Italian horror films generally aren't known for plot coherency or good characterization , but this film doesn't feature any at all . The plot is also hugely inconsistent and doesn't make sense most of the time ; lots of questions are raised and they are nearly all "" Why did that happen ? "" or "" What did he do that for ? "" etc , and that's not a good thing . Of course these inconsistencies are common in a lot of Italian horror films , but then again ; a lot of Italian horror films have more going for them that this one . This film's main asset is defiantly the direction from Michele Soavi . As shown in his previous and later efforts , Soavi has taken a great deal of influence from Argento ; his use of the camera is fantastic , he's also obviously taken the Gothic style and lighting techniques from Dario and it helps this film in creating a creepy atmosphere . The music from the rock band "" Goblin "" is on time and eerie in this movie as it is in a lot of Argento's films . Overall , this movie isn't bad , but it's not good either . As a fan of Italian horror movies , I would be likely to find more to like in this than the average horror fan , but I couldn't find much . Therefore , I recommend this to fans of Italian horror cinema , and suggest for everyone else not to bother .",70535,2248099,False
129,"MARY OF SCOTLAND , caught up in intrigues over which she has no control , finds herself at the mercy of powerful forces that wish her ill . John Ford crafted this meticulous , thoughtful study into the life of the Scottish Queen and the trials & tribulations which buffeted her . With a complicated plot and a very large cast , the film presupposes a certain amount of intelligence on the part of its viewers , as well as an interest in the history of Great Britain . The film is not easy to watch - this is , after all , an historical drama , not a musical comedy - but the viewer's attention should be paid off in the end . Very fine production values also help greatly in the movie's appreciation . Katharine Hepburn is luminous & regal in the title role . Continuing in the tradition of formidable actresses of the 1930's who played queens on the screen ( Colbert , Garbo , Dietrich , Shearer , Robson , Davis ) Hepburn gives a strong portrayal of the stubborn , independently minded Scottish monarch . Kate makes the viewer at once feel an engaging interest in this poor lady , so beset by ? the slings & arrows of outrageous fortune . ' Wisely not speaking in a brogue - the real Mary probably didn't either - Hepburn uses her remarkable face & voice to make this long-dead historical figure come alive . As the Earl of Bothwell , Mary's 3rd husband , Fredric March provides a sturdy hero worth cheering . Here is a man willing to confront any danger for the sake of the woman he loves . If the real Bothwell was perhaps not quite so noble , no matter . March breathes vibrant , pulsing life into the character and embodies him with real strengths & virtues . A large & exceptional cast give fine support to the principals . Some deserve special mention : John Carradine as Mary's tragic Italian secretary , Rizzio ; Douglas Walton as Lord Darnley , Mary's repugnant 2nd husband ; Ian Keith as her unscrupulous half-brother , the Lord Moray . Florence Eldridge stands out in her portrayal of the conflicted Queen Elizabeth . Moroni Olsen as a fiery John Knox ; Donald Crisp as a loyal old laird ; Ralph Forbes & Alan Mowbray as Elizabeth's ambassadors ; and dear old Mary Gordon as a baby nurse - all have their brief moments to shine . Lionel Belmore & Doris Lloyd ( with an unbilled Bobs Watson as their son ) play poor fisher folk who give Mary much needed succor . Ivan Simpson & Nigel de Brulier play two of the wicked English judges who condemn Mary to death . But it is Hepburn the viewer remembers longest . Her shining eyes & majestic mien remain in the mind for a very long timeThe circumstances surrounding the murder of David Rizzio are so well documented that it is somewhat surprising that Ford did not stick more scrupulously to the facts . Darnley and his fellow conspirators entered the Queen's apartments via a private , narrow staircase , hidden in the wall , which communicated directly with Mary's rooms . There is no indication that her bodyguard troops were slain as well , as the film depicts . The script is at pains to keep the Earl of Bothwell a noble hero and uninvolved in Darnley's murder . However , there's little doubt of Bothwell's guilt in the affair . Darnley was not killed outright by the massive explosion - rather he was found , terribly hurt but still alive , lying in a nearby field . He was quickly strangled . The movie does not make clear that it was in Denmark where Bothwell died in prison in 1578 . Mary had divorced him in 1570 . Unlike the relatively short time depicted in the film , Mary was actually a captive of Elizabeth for 19 years , outliving Bothwell by nine years . Elizabeth & Mary never met - it makes good film drama , but it didn't happen .","A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . There is much flit & flutter in THE BIRD SHOP , especially after a vicious black cat gets in and goes after a baby canary . . . This is a fairly interesting little black & white cartoon , with lots of action / reaction animation . The pace really picks up with the arrival of the ferocious feline . Movie mavens will notice that four of the birds are spoofs of the Marx Brothers . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most fascinating of all animated series . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .",306861,306861,True
130,"I've read some pretty bad reviews of this little parody , mostly from people who thought it was simply bad taste . But Lord of the Piercing is not the title that you give to something that you expect to be entered into the Short Film Hall of Fame . Sure , it was mostly childish humor , but if there is a place for bad humor , this is it . Before you condemn this little comedy for being tasteless , keep in mind that they make full length feature films out of this same kind of humor and then charge 8 or 9 dollars to see it at the theaters . Lord of the Piercing is a good-natured parody of The Fellowship of the Ring that has it's place as an intro skit at the Academy Awards ceremony and as a little extra tidbit on the DVD . It is nothing more than that and it knows that , and that commands some respect in itself . Besides that , it was hilarious ! Jack Black continues to grow as one of the funniest men working in the movies today ( which is good , considering having performed several unenviable roles , such as that in Cable Guy and , even more , The Jackal ) . No one has seen him in Run Ronnie Run yet , because at the time I'm writing this review , that movie has yet to be released because of it's extremely vulgar content ( much of which involves a song performance by Jack Black ) , but I seriously hope they get moving on that . I saw it at an advance screening almost two years ago and just about fell out of my chair laughing . Jack Black proves himself more and more with every performance that he delivers , and even the wooden and virtually talentless Sarah Michelle Gellar had some good moments in the Lord of the Piercing . They made excellent use of original footage from the film to enhance the quality of their parody , making the story that they installed that much more impressive .

As in Hitchcock's "" The Lady Vanishes , "" the concierge and staff deny having seen him . They claim Simmons arrived alone . Simmons pokes around but all the signs of Tomlinson's visit has disappeared . Even his room is gone . The British Consul , Felix Aylmer , would like to help but , he tells her , without any evidence , he's helpless . He advises her to find someone who has met both of them during their one night in Paris . That person exists , in the person of the English artist Dirk Bogarde . Bogarde had borrowed some money from Tomlinson the night before and they'd had a brief , polite conversation . Bogarde is determined to discover what happened to Tomlinson . Together , Bogarde and Simmons do in fact find his whereabouts and the reason for his disappearance . This isn't a psychological mystery along the lines of "" Bunny Lake is Missing "" or "" The Turn of the Screw . "" There's never any doubt that Tomlinson is a real human being . And it isn't long before we see the manager of the hotel and her staff toasting his absence , so we know they're in cahoots . It's a genteel mystery , not a sinister one . There isn't any physical action and nobody is genuinely evil . The problem I have is with the concierge , played by Cathleen Nesbitt . Simmons keeps poking around , bringing in the police and generally disrupting the operations of the hotel , and the concierge is consistently polite , suggesting in a friendly way that perhaps Mademoiselle is a little mad . This runs contrary to my experience with concierges . They are uniformly rude to guests . And money grubbing too . And when they write the number 1 it always comes out looking like a 7 . They do this quite deliberately to confound visiting Americans . Oh , there's a conspiracy all right but it involves EVERY concierge in Paris , and now , not just in 1896 . No "" politesse "" , if you know what I mean ! It's an enjoyable movie . It's always nice to see mysteries unraveled piece by piece . I suppose that's why Agatha Christie has always been a best seller , and the Sherlock Holmes stories before her . In the best of them , we flood out with relief at the end . In that respect , this climactic reveal is a bit of an anti-climax . I won't give away the reason why Tomlinson disappeared but it's pretty prosaic . Still , Jean Simmons is a handsome young lady . Interesting to see her play a scene with Felix Aylmer . This movie was released in 1950 . Two years earlier Simmons had been Ophelia and Aylmer was her father , Polonius , in Olivier's "" Hamlet .

132,"Wow , was all I had to say after leaving this movie . I mention the director , George Miller , in the opening one line because it's of note , at least in my line of thinking , to notice where the bending-genre-conventions comes from for Happy Feet . We have seen this , to be sure , in the Babe pictures , where a pig went to great lengths to show that he was more than what his environment defined himself as . But there's even the sense of the outsider coming to save the day , against all odds , ala Mad Max in those crazy Australian films . And , like all of those previous works , Happy Feet actually works , very well , and not just for one set . Going into it maybe my expectations weren't too high , despite seeing Miller's name on the credits - his first directing a practically all-animated ( computer no less , in a time where it's as common as bugs in a tree stump ) - because seeing commercials I thought it would just be another cute kids movie . It also has penguins , which I thought would be sort of appealing , and the possibility that Robin Williams might finally get some good voice time in more than one role . Boy does he ever , but the film has much more for its whole audience , including even some political commentary amid the wild comedy and set pieces . What I ended up getting was some kind of bizarre , unique hybrid of the central concept of Dumbo ( the loner cast-aside from his world , has to use his individuality , likely an influence of the Babe pictures ) , the jukebox mania of something akin to Moulin Rouge , the facts and environment of March of the Penguins ( to be sure , as one can't separate one without the other ) , and even current events . We get the story of Mumble ( Babe voice EG Daily , and Elijah Wood ) , who is born from an Elvis impresario ( Hugh Jackman ) and a supportive mother ( Nicole Kidman ) , in a world where all the penguins sing , not just for mating but for some kind of right to live and hunt for fish . Mumble , however , can only dance , fantastically ( in style via Savion Glover behind the scenes ) , but it doesn't sit well with Noah ( Hugo Weaving ) , head of the elder penguins . He's first cast out by his fellow penguins for not fitting in , and being a terrible singer . He meets up with outsider penguins ( headed by Ramon , voice by Williams , in one of the roles ) , and tries to appeal back to the group of penguins - knowing that aliens are involved somewhere . But when he's rejected again , even more harshly , his journey to find the aliens goes on , which leads to . . . Oh , what's the use . To go on about the plot would be fruitless , but you might get the idea from reading this how silly the movie sounds - at first . But I think Miller and his team are going for a smart ridiculous spirit , one that is actually successfully irreverent for all ages , which is one of the toughest things that any filmmaker can try for . Even tougher is to see Robin Williams tackle roles and actually succeed comically . But it's his best , most rip-roaringly hilarious ( and I don't use the former term lightly ) performance since Aladdin . He goes between a solemn narrator , Ramon the penguin , and Lovelace , the possible link to everything with the ' aliens ' . The musical side of things could be a challenge too , as it is in the Moulin Rouge mode of not being at all original-songs , but done in an extreme , over-the-top manner with the visuals . Imagine dozens and dozens of penguins singing "" Somebody to Love "" by Queen , sounds risky , but it actually works , well . In fact , Happy Feet does what Moulin Rouge did better than that film actually went for - it's a pop-culture shake-up for characters who see humans as aliens , most especially due to a lack of food . But then there's even the touch of political commentary , which is most surprising . It would be one thing to have an over the top fantasy comedy with bits of romance thrown in ( and there's even some genre-breaking with what ends up between Mumble and Gloria ) , but it's another to be making a kind of underlying point to it all that while lost on the kids won't be lost to some in the audience . This is even something that goes back to the Road Warrior , only here it's perhaps not as explicit - one could read into the ' leader ' penguins who cast out Mumble with his ' outsider ' friends who are not at all like the others , or the significance when Mumble finally comes back from his self-imposed mission , as being like the now - and the control over what the fish does to the group . But that's only a side-bar - however interesting - for what's really appealing about Happy Feet . It's unexpectedly , even outrageously in its silly way , funny , and it's based totally on the characters , and building on it how ridiculous - yet within the logic of the picture believable - how singing / dancing penguins can be in this world . Too often , especially in 2006 , the slew of computer-animated movies for kids that just don't seem appealing . Granted , I'm not a tot anymore , but just on the level of anything in the subject matter being anything more than ' hey , they're animals , they make stupid jokes , its worth it ' is lost on me . Happy Feet stands above all the other animated pictures of this year , including Pixar's work , by delivering truly successfully excitement and absurdity in equal measure , while not doing so to a lower common denominator . I can't wait to recommend this to most of the people I know , and they're not even kids . Miller - welcome to the 21st century !","CAPOTE is a great movie . Let that be said at the beginning of this review . The superb screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke in turn based on that part of the life of Truman Capote when he was obsessed with writing his final and finest novel ' In Cold Blood ' , and the extraordinary directing by Bennett Miller who influenced a fine production crew and coaxed brilliant performances from his cast is all a well established fact . That all of this could be brought together in the featurettes that accompany the film on the DVD release is an example of just how fine additive commentaries can be . This is not only a superb film ; it is also an equally superb DVD package . Philip Seymour Hoffman as the idiosyncratic author Truman Capote probes the psyche of this strange but gifted writer from his first newspaper clipping of the November 15 , 1959 brutal murders of the Clutter family in Holbrook through his immersion in the tiny Kansas town accompanied by his friend and fellow writer Harper Lee ( Catherine Keener ) absorbing the atmosphere where such a deed could happen , ingratiating himself with investigator Alvin Dewey ( Chris Cooper ) and his wife Marie ( Amy Ryan ) to gain access to information that will eventually result in material for his projected book . He becomes obsessed with the murderers Perry Smith ( Clifton Collins , Jr . ) and Richard Hickock ( Mark Pellegrino ) , connecting with Smith in particular on a very basic level and providing the men with lawyers to appeal their conviction for a long enough time to eventually hear the truth of the night of grisly mayhem that fascinates Capote so . The story ends with the execution of Smith and Hickock in 1965 , an occasion that further bewilders the now fragile mind of Capote as he gains the end to his story while simultaneously watching the loved Smith dangle from the scaffold in death . Each actor is exceptional here : Hoffman does indeed deserve his Oscar for a brilliant portrayal . But it is the aftermath that brings even more poignancy to the film . Hearing Bennett , Clarke , and Futterman discuss the origin of the cinematic idea blends naturally with the production crews ' commentary about the choice of Winnipeg , Canada as the location to depict Kansas , the thorough preparation of the design and costuming and color palette and camera techniques , and then the comments by four of the main actors ( Hoffman , Keener , Cooper , and Collins ) illuminate not only the characters they depicted in the film but also the dynamics of entering into this strange world of bleak winter murder . The effect of the featurettes is staggering and makes the viewer want to immediately replay the entire movie . This DVD package should serve as the template for future releases : the disc in its entirety is an art form that has few peers . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp",453068,3223254,False

135,"Pat O'Brien portrays the title character , a strictly by the book rookie patrolman in New York's 7th Precinct , in this formulaic story that will have you experience a range of emotions , as does O'Malley before it's all over . "" I just love to watch him pull out that manual "" - so says newspaper reporter Pinky Holden ( Hobart Cavanaugh ) , who takes great pleasure in taking shots at O'Malley and the Police Department under his byline . O'Malley is so strict in fact , that he pulls out the manual and admonishes his own mother when she throws a handful of crumbs out her apartment window for the birds - it's littering after all ! When O'Malley stops John Phillips ( Humphrey Bogart ) for a loud muffler , it causes Phillips to be late for his first job in a long time . With a wife and young daughter , Phillips loses his chance for work when he arrives late and finds the gate to his factory job shut down . You can more or less guess what follows - the frustrated Phillips accidentally injures a pawn shop owner and takes four hundred dollars out of the till . Arrested and sentenced to a minimum two year prison stretch , Mrs . Phillips ( Frieda Inescort ) is left alone to care for daughter Babs ( Sybil Jason ) , who's suffered a knee injury that cannot receive proper medical attention because of their meager circumstances . O'Malley realizes what he's done and attempts to set things right , even though by now , the neighborhood takes him for a real hard nosed pain in the butt . Ultimately , it's young Babs Phillips who helps O'Malley understand the error of his ways , at first not knowing of her connection to the man he helped put away . The humbled officer seeks medical treatment for the young girl , and arranges for Phillips ' early parole , all in secret . By the time the story ends , O'Malley has done a complete turn , and is now the one who tries to model compassion for his captain and fellow officers .

For her part , actress Ann Sheridan appeared with both actors in this film and "" San Quentin "" , all are recommended .","Even for a movie , this story defies credibility on so many levels that it begins to parody itself . It starts with a nice enough guy , Nick Allen ( William Hall ) looking for employment in a new town , who's suddenly caught up in a street fight and taking a bullet for a young lady accosted by a couple of thugs . His wound is treated in a ritzy apartment by a doctor making a house call at no charge . I was waiting for the moment when all the surreal events would catch up with him , but instead , Nick winds up in a getaway car when a policeman is shot chasing down mobster Capper Regan ( Dean Jagger ) and his henchmen . Not once did Nick ever question what was going on , or attempt to bail out , instead he joins the crooks as they take it on the lam . What defies reason the most though is how not one , but all three of the petty hoods wind up having a green acres moment and decide that they'd rather give up their life of crime in favor of the peace and solitude of rural life . Along the way , one might ask what ever happened to Nick's bullet wound , since he's shown going swimming without even a scratch ; and by the way , where did the spiffy swim trunks come from ? Maybe with a little more thought , something credible might have been salvaged from the concept attempted here , but as it is , it just doesn't work . Individually , each of the characters is likable enough , including bad guys Spudsy Baker ( Ward Bond ) and Red Graham ( Murray Alper ) , along with Capper's moll Jo Elliott ( Steffi Duna ) , who starts out a little rough but mellows as the story progresses ; those chicks put her over the edge . There are a couple of romances thrown in for good measure too , though the only one who makes it through the story maintaining some semblance of character integrity is Bill the German Shepherd , and he had to take a bullet too !",2707735,2707735,True

This slasher film , while much better then the only previous ' 8 films to Die For ' movies ( the abysmal "" the Broken "" ) was not without it's own problems . The film moves at a steady clip when it gets going and some of the gore is impressive . But it's also quite predictable , has a clichéd storyline and under-developed characters .

However , every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story , and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films . Through it's well observed and very real characters , Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss , heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are . We follow Seita and Setsuko , a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country . How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a ( somewhat ) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie . I'm not a big fan of animation , but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant , and this is one of those films . The animation is beautiful and certain scenes , including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art . The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful , and helps add to the tragedy of the story . Because we are able to care for the characters , the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one , but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair . The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched , let alone animated pictures . The fact that it's so plain and blatant , with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion .

No PULP FICTION or GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY , but still a decent amount of spaghetti-western-style fun .",". . or La Fayette , the French spelling . The first thing to bear in mind is that , at the time , it was the biggest budget France had ever spent for a movie : hence the cast which includes Orson Welles as Franklin - a part he had already played in Sacha Guitry's "" si Versailles m'était conté "" - , Vittorio DeSica , Jack Hawkins , Edmund Purdom , Liselotte Pulver ; on the other hand , the French stars are not big names : Pascale Audret and Michel LeRoyer were far from being very famous compared with Bardot , Delon , Belmondo , Ventura or Moreau . Other assets were Claude Renoir's peerless cinematography and a lilting tuneful score . But the harsh truth is that Dreville's epic is virtually forgotten in today's French collective memory : it has completely disappeared from dictionaries of films even the ones which feature the worst bombs though . And it's certainly unfair . Michel Dreville has never been an unrecognized genius as his earlier works testify : melodrama - the priceless weepie "" la cage aux rossignols "" - , biographies - "" horizons sans fin "" about female pilot Hélène Boucher - , Alexandre Dumas - the first version of "" la reine Margot , which , despite of Jeanne Moreau , is inferior to Chereau's remake with Isabelle Adjani . As for his comedies ( "" les sept péchés capitaux "" , "" à pied , à cheval ou en spoutnik "" ) , since we cannot say something nice . His best works are probably "" copie conforme "" , thanks to Louis Jouvet , an actor so great any movie he makes cannot be bad , and this "" Lafayette "" . "" Lafayette ' is not really a biography for Lafayette's story is far from being over after his American adventure : he played a prominent part in the French revolution and even during the Restoration . Michel Le Royer is well cast as the lead : he has youth , panache and enthusiasm going for him and he's credible - it was a hard task because the marquis was barely twenty - : he embodies the end of the courtier , as Louis the Fourteenth wanted the noble to be : the scene with Monsieur , the king's brother is revealing . Lafayette was ahead of his time , a visionary who had read the philosophers and who felt things were about to change : "" now liberty has a home "" he says , on his way back to France . He could have added "" and its home is not mine "" . First part takes place in France , after a short prologue which shows Brave New World's plight ; the second one makes good use of the cinemascope for the battles scene . The dialogue is above average . Besides , the director displays respect for the audience : the American and English speak English - there are a lot of subtitles - , and the French French , which , at the time was not that much obvious . Even Lafayette tries his hand at English with a funny accent . And unlike "" the patriot "" , in Dreville's movie , the English are not sadistic brutes and nasty executionersHistorians are going to say that , for instance , Marie - Antoinette and Lafayette , were not as thick as thieves , and that the queen called the New World hero "" Monsieur Blondinet "" ( = fair-haired boy , meant pejoratively ) .

142,"The print of this film which I viewed had credits and intertitles printed on different film stock from the actors ' footage . . . and the title footage is older . This may explain why the title ' Madcap Madge ' doesn't match the film proper , in which the main character's name is Betty . In silent films , it was a fairly common practice for film exhibitors and re-issuers to rename a character by striking a new set of titles , or even giving the film itself a completely new title . . . sometimes for copyright reasons , sometimes to avoid paying distribution fees . Once again , a film that was "" lost forever "" turns out merely to have been mislaid . Even happier news is the fact that ' Madcap Madge ' stars Olive Thomas , an extremely beautiful and talented actress of the middle silent-film period , whose career is now sadly forgotten because of her tragic early death . ' Madcap Madge ' is a splendid showcase for her comedic talents , as well as her physical agility and her beauty . One of the few things I dislike about this movie is its contrived title . How often , in real life , does anybody ever actually speak the word ' madcap ' ? Not very often nowadays , and I doubt that it was heard frequently in 1917 . SPOILERS AHEAD . Mr Flower ( J Frank Burke ) is a respectable banker who isn't as prosperous as he seems : he has overdrawn his finances , and the notes are about to be called in . His wife Mrs Flower is a snob with social aspirations ( played by Aggie Herring : a name to conjure with , and an actress who looks more like a washerwoman than a banker's wife ) . Elder daughter Julia ( well-played by Dorcas Matthews ) is prim and serious : she hopes to marry a wealthy swain to improve her father's finances and her mother's social standing . The problem is younger daughter Betty ( Thomas ) , whose practical jokes and monkeyshines are an embarrassment to the rest of her family . The Flowers have packed Betty off to a boarding school , which ought to get her out of the way . . . or does it ? Just as Mrs Flower and Julia are planning a husband-hunt in Palm Beach , Betty is expelled from the boarding school for her shenanigans . ( I found this unlikely , since boarding schools depend on their students ' tuition for their income ; a student would have to be VERY unruly for the school willingly to give up that income . ) When teenage Betty lands up in Palm Beach , Julia ( for contrived reasons ) orders her younger sister to dress as a ten-year-old girl : an appropriate age , since Betty is acting like a ten-year-old anyway . Julia is scheming to marry the Earl of Larsdale ( J Barney Sherry ) , a wealthy English peer . SPOILERS COMING NOW . Since our sympathies are with Betty and against her sister , it's no surprise that the earl decides that he prefers Madge to Julia . . . once he realises that Betty is no ten-year-old . And the earl has been conducting a masquerade of his own : he's actually a wealthy American , who holds the notes on Mr Flower's bank ! Happy endings all round . Olive Thomas , age 18 at this time , is surprisingly believable ( and appealing ) as a fake 10-year-old . In her ' grown-up ' scenes in this comedy , I found her quite appealing and sexy . . . and , during her disguise sequences , I found it unnerving that I accepted her as a ( fake ) ten-year-old while still finding her very sexy ! Miss Thomas's bustline was minimal , yet there's one good sight gag involving her bust when she's supposedly a 10-year-old . Dorcas Matthews gives an excellent performance in a role that's meant to be unsympathetic , yet in which I found her likable . As the faux earl , JB Sherry seems a bit too old for Olive Thomas , but plenty of other movies have featured romantic couples with similar age discrepancies . Since this is a silent film , it entirely evades the question of whether or not the fake earl speaks with an English accent . The film's exterior scenes are attractive , though poorly photographed , and the camera set-ups are less imaginative than they might be . My single biggest complaint about this movie is that some of the intertitles are too busy and elaborate . ( Since these are clearly replacements for the originals , perhaps the original release print's titles were simpler and more effective . ) But the film is funny , and it serves as an excellent vehicle for Olive Thomas's beauty and acting skills . I'll rate ' Madcap Madge ' .","While some purists were disappointed in this work , I found it quite refreshing . There is the appropriate tongue-in-cheek fun , indicative of the massively - popular 70's television series ; clever humor , and a wonderful story line .

143,"This made for TV horror thriller is a lot better than it's ridiculous title would have you believe , which is really saying something since the title is actually a pretty apt description of what goes on in the movie . It starts out with a girl acting really strangely , running away something that isn't identified and then turning up dead . Her sister doesn't accept the police's quick decision to label it a suicide and close the case . Surely there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they are right , but then again , they don't take supernatural explanations into account so her sister Elizabeth decides to take the investigation into her own hands . Suspicious that the girl's school that her sister attended at the time of her death may have had something to do with what happened to her , Elizabeth enrolls into the school to do some investigating of her own . I don't know how fresh the idea of that premise was in 1973 , but it works pretty well here . There are some slip-ups , like when Elizabeth meets the Head Mistress for an interview and spouts some nonsense like "" Picasso was a realist painter before he was an impressionist . "" Not that I don't accept that someone her age would have any knowledge about that ( it is , after all , not exactly the kind of knowledge reserved for geniuses ) , it's just that it's so out of place in this movie . I guess I should respect such an attempt at three dimensional characterization though . Horror movies are , after all , historically lacking in this area . I got Satan's School for Girls on a 10-movie collection that I bought for $15 , since I have something of a love of old , crappy horror movies ( and you can't beat that price ! ) , otherwise I would never have seen it . To be sure , this is one of those movies that is actually worth watching but has a title that is incredibly efficient in making people want to see it . Who would want to watch a movie with a title like this ? I imagine that's part of the reason that the remake with Shannon Dougherty came and went instantaneously with little to no attention . And this really is unfortunate , because the movie certainly has some tense moments . The scene where Elizabeth goes searching the basement for the room where the painting of her sister took place is wonderfully creepy . Even that painting itself is a great prop . The psychology teacher in the movie is a little too obvious . I think it's safe to say that no character should ever act as evil or nutty as this guy did . When he's not threatening girls with a huge knife he's making rats go insane in his lab . This guy can NOT be well balanced . It actually is a pretty clever technique to have designed the cavernous basement like the rat maze in his classroom , but if the person acting insane turns out to be the bad guy then the movie is too predictable , and if they turn out to be completely innocent then it becomes too clear that the movie was trying to deliberately lead you in the wrong direction , which in turn requires a Scooby-Doo ending because they need to explain why we were wrong the whole time in thinking exactly what they wanted us to think . The movie takes something of a downturn in the third act , as the cheesy acting starts to tip the scales against the creepy atmosphere , which is no longer creepy enough to justify overlooking how bad the acting is . There is a ludicrous scene where the professor can't get out of a pond because there are girls all around him poking him with sticks . If they had established earlier on that he can't swim , fine , but any warm-blooded human being , man or woman , would have simply grabbed onto the first stick that poked him or her and yanked the girl holding it right into the pond . It would not be hard to do , obviously . But there I go nitpicking . I just have a hard time with scenes like that . It's like when someone takes a person hostage , holding a gun to their head while the whole police force stands with their guns aimed , and they all drop their guns like incompetent morons . In all my years of movie watching , only twice have I seen anybody acknowledge how effective it would be to just shoot the guy ( one was RoboCop , and the other was Charlie Sheen in Navy Seals ) . You wouldn't even have to kill him , Shooting the gunman in the arm would usually not endanger the victim at all and would completely incapacitate the gunman from being able to fire . There I go nitpicking AGAIN . Stop me next time , will you ? I don't remember there being any shooting in Satan's School for Girls ( although there is a gun ) , and there is little to no gore either , the movie is almost solely driven by its atmosphere , which most of the time is not very effective but a few times is VERY effective . For 70s horror , this is definitely one of the better ones ( excluding the giants , like The Exorcist , which are , of course , in a class all their own ) . Certainly worth seeing for horror buffs .","It's extremely rare that you will see any of these supplemental documentaries that are really anything other than short films where the main cast and crew get on camera and talk about how everyone was the greatest people that any of them ever met and they were like a family and they felt like they knew each other for their whole lives and they'll be friends forever and blah blah blah blah . In a good documentary , somewhere along the way there will be some insights revealed into the meaning of the movie or interesting stories about the making of the movie ( there are tons of these on , say , The Exorcist , for example ) or , in the most shining cases , things can be revealed about the intentions in making the movie that can make a bad movie seem a lot better than you thought after you finished watching it . The 2003 Willard remake and Texas Chainsaw III , believe it or not , come to mind . Unfortunately , in this one all we have is everyone getting on camera and talking about how great everyone else was , and there is also tons of talk about the extensive preparations that were done to make sure that everyone felt like a family around each other in this huge Rhode Island house . Not that there's anything wrong with that , except that Dan in Real Life is just such a drab , uninteresting movie with characters who have absolutely no chemistry with each other , so it was a little sad to see all of these talented actors get on camera and talk about how brilliant everything was .

149,"Silent-film comedian Snub Pollard gave hilarious performances in some Hal Roach short comedies , yet Pollard never managed to develop a character who could sustain a feature - length film . Even some of his short films contain a split-level structure , with the story abruptly changing direction midway through the movie . One of Pollard's best shorts , ' At the Ringside ' , is a good example of this : the first half of the movie is an imitation of Charlie Chaplin's ' Easy Street ' , then the second half deals with a boxing match . ' Before the Public ' , running roughly 2 , 000 feet , appears to be as close as Pollard ever got to starring in a feature film . . . and , as with ' At the Ringside ' , this is really two different stories in one film . Back when movies were silent , cinemas often employed singers to provide musical accompaniment to magic-lantern slides or to the silent films . Oliver Hardy , in fact , got his start in movies by singing behind the projection screen at a cinema in his native Georgia . ' Before the Public ' starts out with Pollard as a small-town rube who is similarly employed . He stands next to the screen in his local cinema , singing to accompany the images on magic - lantern slides . We can't hear Snub's voice in this silent movie , but his facial acrobatics ( and the cinema audience's reactions ) make it clear that he's a terrible singer . The audiences routinely bring fruit and vegetables into the picture-show , to throw at Snub . An amusing gag reveals that there's a greengrocer's stall next-door over to the picture palace . . . and Snub keeps it well-stocked with the produce that the audiences throw at him ! Along comes one of those publicity gimmicks that were so widespread during silent-movie days : a popularity contest , with the winner receiving a trip to Hollywood and a screen test . Well , Snub is definitely the most UN-popular person in town , but all the townspeople are so eager to get rid of Snub that they rig the contest in his favour , so that he'll win the trip . Amazingly , Snub becomes a Hollywood star . ( Rather ironic , this , since Pollard was never more than a second-rank film comedian in real life . ) I was pleased that this movie's script avoids that cliché which I really dislike : the one about the dead-earnest idiot who wants to be a serious dramatic actor , but who is so inept with it that he becomes a comedy star by mistake . Apparently , Pollard's character has actually become a movie star by his own efforts . Now he comes back home in triumph , exhibiting his starring movie at the same small-town cinema where he was once a humble target for groceries . Unfortunately , this is the point where ' Before the Public ' becomes an entirely different movie , as we see the film within the film . It's a western . The good news is that Pollard's usual sidekicks Noah Young ( as the villain ) and Marie Mosquini ( as the heroine ) are on hand . The bad news is that Pollard's cowboy movie is just one more lame collection of cowboy clichés , all quite predictable and most of them unfunny . The great Jimmy Finlayson is in ' Before the Public ' , but is sadly given very little to do . Mostly out of fondness for Snub Pollard and respect for his career - - he made a graceful segue into small supporting roles , lasting well into the sound era - - I'll rate this effort .","' Creo en Dios ' takes its title from the first words of the apostles ' creed in Spanish . This Mexican film was made more than a decade before Alfred Hitchcock's Canadian film ' I Confess ' , yet there are startling parallels between them . In ' I Confess ' , a Catholic commits a murder and then confesses the deed to his priest , attaining absolution for the sin if not for the earthly crime . When the priest becomes falsely suspected of the murder , he is unable to exonerate himself by naming the killer . Alfred Hitchcock was educated in a Catholic seminary , and apparently he genuinely accepted some aspects of Catholic dogma . In ' I Confess ' , the priest is genuinely incapable of naming the murderer , because God prevents the priest from violating the secrets of the confessional : Hitchcock seemed to accept the dogmatic truth of this . But non-Catholic film audiences did not , and ' I Confess ' was a flop at the box office . Here in ' Creo en Dios ' we have the same premise , with slightly different results . A murder is committed in a Mexican village . The murderer's identity is known to the audience : he is Antonio ( Miguel Inclán ) . The only villager who knows that Antonio is guilty is his wife Carmen ( Isabela Corona ) . Father Bernal ( Fernando Soler ) is hearing confession in his church . When Carmen blurts out her own sins to the priest , he realises that Carmen's husband is the killer . Yet Bernal's priestly vows prevent him from divulging this information to the authorities . But then Father Bernal is suspected of the murder . He cannot clear himself without violating his vows . . . I found ' Creo en Dios ' slightly more plausible than Hitchcock's version of this premise . Whereas Hitchcock seemed to believe ( and expected us to believe ) that some supernatural barrier prevented his priest from speaking the truth , in ' Creo en Dios ' it is clear to us that Father Bernal is physically capable of speaking the truth , but chooses not to do so because he holds his priestly vows to be more sacred - - and more important - - than his own innocence and his personal freedom . SPOILERS COMING NOW . Somewhat less plausibly , Bernal chooses to keep schtum because he fervently believes that Antonio's conscience will impel him to confess . Amazingly enough , this happens . My greatest problem with ' Creo en Dios ' is that it's far too long , too slow and too talky . The characters ' motivations are plausible only if we recognise that this is a community in which the religious beliefs have been embedded so deeply as to become superstition . In our modern world , murders are committed every day of the week by people who feel no pricking of conscience . ' Creo en Dios ' manages to be slightly more plausible than Hitchcock's treatment of this theme , but there isn't so much as a shadow of Hitchcock's cinematic skill on view in this boring morality play . I'll rate this movie .",1609079,1609079,True

Cunningham had previously worked with Aphex Twin and so they contributed to this project - resulting in a mix between narrative and music video , similar to Michael Jackson's "" Thriller . "" The video begins with a close-up night-vision shot of an alien creature named Rubber Johnny . A doctor seems to be talking to him - asking what's wrong , if he wants his mother , etc . Rubber Johnny seems incapable of speaking like a human and can only emit high-pitch frequency noises . The next scene shows Johnny in a wheelchair , his enormous head leaning backwards . His small pet dog watches as Johnny suddenly comes to live in an array of dazzling special effects shots and "" dances "" ( to some extent ) to Aphex Twin . The music is interrupted twice by Johnny's father opening the door into the basement and muttering unintelligible curses at him . My first thought after this was over : What a bizarre feature ! It actually might disturb some people - it's kind of unsettling and uncomfortable to watch . Also , as Johnny dances he occasionally flies full-speed into see-through glass , leaving remnants of his distorted face on the objects .

By the way , for those interested , it is freely available to view on YouTube . com , and is also available for purchase on DVD through Cunningham's official website .","Cannibal ! The Musical  is inspired by the true story of Alferd Packer ( although his real name was allegedly "" Alfred "" and "" Alferd "" came about because he didn't know how to spell his own name correctly ) . Packer was one of only two men - along with Albert Fish - to ever be convicted of cannibalism in America . ( Apparently serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer had enough going against him already that he wasn't tried for cannibalism on top of mass murder ) . Packer led a group of five men into Colorado in search of gold . They got lost and were stranded in desolate conditions , and eventually Packer killed his men and ate them . ( Although according to Wikipedia recent evidence indicates he never killed them , and in 1981 he was apparently acquitted of crimes long after his death . I guess they figured eating people who are already dead in order to survive doesn't qualify as full-out cannibalism . I'm not really sure about the specifics on how that works . ) Trey Parker and Matt Stone made this movie before "" South Park . "" I believe it was actually filmed in 1994 and first screened at the Alferd Packer College ( yes , there's a college named after him ) which is presumably located in Colorado . It's become a cult film over the years and the title was changed to "" Cannibal : The Musical "" after Troma producers convinced Trey that not enough people outside of the state were aware of who Alferd Packer actually was . ( I certainly wasn't - I thought it was a fictional character before looking up the film on Wikipedia . ) First things first - I have so far been largely unimpressed by Trey and Matt's live-action ventures . I've become a huge "" South Park "" fan within the past year or so , but I bought "" Orgazmo "" on DVD and thought it was a very juvenile and average comedy , and although I have not seen "" BASEketball "" yet , even Trey and Matt have acknowledged that it is not a good film , so I don't feel like I'm entirely missing out . "" Cannibal "" is a huge cult film and I had heard a lot of good things about it from various people on the Internet , in particular one Troma video fan . Well , this is my first Troma video ( if it qualifies as one ) and maybe that's part of the reason I couldn't get into it . Parts of it are very funny , but for the most part it really isn't very humorous at all . It actually develops something of a story and isn't as loud or obvious as some of Parker's other material . "" South Park "" is very satirical and witty but it's much more obvious than the comedy here , which is tamer and not quite as edgy . Some of the songs are quite funny but a number of them are inferior versions of songs that would appear in the "" South Park "" movie and "" Team America : World Police . "" Songs from that film like "" The End of an Act "" ( the one that bashes Ben Affleck and Michael Bay ) are much cleverer and musically catchy than anything found here . The cast is generally weak and Trey is visibly awkward throughout - presumably since it was his first real movie . It's very low-budget ( filmed for $125 , 000 - compared to the eventual $1 million they received per episode of "" That's My Bush ! "" in 2001 ) , and part of the reason the film isn't as engrossing at times is due to its budget : it looks like a student movie made by some friends who made up a lot of gags as they went along . . . and for the most part that's probably a rather accurate summary . I know the film has a cult following and an impressive rating on this site , but I think if you're not a die-hard Trey Parker fan or a follower of the Troma film series , it'll leave you a bit underwhelmed , especially if you're familiar with the boys ' recent work on "" South Park "" and "" Team America . "" It has its strong points but they are far and few between , and for the most part it's a very amateurish production that isn't up to par with their later stuff .

Having with him a number of Hitler youths , blond and blue eyed golden nuggets as Hitler calls them , and two of his top henchmen Josef Gobbels and Hermann Goering , Joel Gray & Glenn Shadix , to make him feel at home ; together with an SS typist , Doug McKeon , who takes down every word that Hitler says . We the audience are given a deep and rare insight into Hitler's mind and what he thought of himself his place in history and the crimes that he committed during his lifetime . Hitler talking about his great accomplishments , good and bad , that made him undoubtedly one of the most feared recognized and written about persons in world history makes up most of the dialog in the film . In this in-between world of life and death is also Hitler's bride of one day , April 1945 , and long time mistress Eva Braun , Camilla Soeberg . There's also Sigmund Freud , Peter Michael Goetz , thrown into the movie who spends most of his time on screen psycho-analyzing Hitler to Hitler great annoyance and disgust .

A lot of what Hitler says in the movie "" The Empty Mirror "" has mostly to do with his generals and how they double-crossed and betrayed him in the war by selling out to save their own necks at his and Germanys expense . We also see and hear Hitler crying about how he'll , sob sob , never be able to make the German capital of Berlin the great modern metropolis that he envisioned it to be ; with him seen sadly playing , like a little boy , with a toy scale model of the city . Hitler also admits that his two greatest mistakes in the war was his invasion of the USSR in the summer of 1941 and later that year declaring war against the United States as an obligation that he had to his Japanese allies , after that country's attack on Pearl Horbor . This just days after his panzer divisions were defeated and thrown back from the gates of Moscow by the Red Army and the brutal Russian Winter . The movie gets overly esoteric as Hitler starts to suddenly turn snow white and age becoming almost unrecognizable , looking like an unkempt and disheveled Captain Kangaroo , as he sees the results of his actions , that throughout the movie he tried to overlook and ignore . Hitler sees films of liberated concentration camps and the thousands of dead found in them and literally goes mad as if that's his ultimate punishment . Interesting but just a bit too talky of a movie with Hitler , as if he's in a Broadway Musical , having a number of unnecessary costume changes as if to show us in the audience what and extensive wardrobe he had and how good he look wearing it . We even see Hitler cracking jokes , which no one with him in the bunker would dare , about himself as if he were doing some stand-up comic routine . The films of Hitler and Nazi Germany get a bit too much since they never for once let up and give you a chance to digest what's happening in the movie . By the time "" The Empty Mirror "" is over your almost as worn out watching the movie as Hitler or actor Norman Rodway is in being in it .","Lincoln goes to the consulate trying to prove that Michael is innocent and killed a hit-man in self-defense ; he discovers that in Sona , the prisoners are left by themselves and without any guard after a violent riot .

155,"SPOILERS Surprisingly good made for TV movie about the short life and violent death of Colleen Applegate who was known by her many fans as porno film star Shauna Grant . Born in California and later moving to the little tree-lined Minnesota town , pop 3 , 500 , of Farmingdale Colleen was a beautiful and friendly girl . It turned out that her looks and girl-next-door persona was what brought her to the life that she lead and suffered through from 1981 to 1984 ending up with a bullet in her skull . After lingering for two days on life support Colleen finally passed away on March 23 1984 just two months shy of her 21th birthday . About to graduate from high school and go out in the world for the first time just turned 18 year-old Bannon Kansas High School cheerleader Pauleen Anderson , Joanna Lee , is about as naive and unfamiliar with the world outside Bannon as she is about what going on in Jupiter or Mars . Determained to make something of herself Pauleen quickly quits a job at the local phone company that her father , Dennis Howard , a supervisor there got for her . Knowing that she's about the most beautiful girl in town and having her boyfriend Cory Parker , Kris Kamm , willing to drive her and himself out to L . A Pauleen says goodbye to Bannon and her parents Del and Sharon Anderson , Medlinda Dillon . Pauleen feels that she has all the qualities that can make her a top fashion model or even movie star and the sooner she starts the better things will be for her . After knocking around the beach and town Pauleen finally lands a job for this modeling agency , Selby , where the owner Lou Gates , Ben Frank , an ex-professional boxer sees that Pauleen has a lot of talent as a future model and quickly get her started in a series photo session at his studio . We see right away that Pauleen is not that eager to take her clothes off since her upbringing back in Bannon was anything but ultra-liberal in the sexual freedoms that were so common in places like L . A San Francisco or New York back then during the "" sexual revolution "" . With a little prodding by Lou Pauleen starts to get the hang of things as a nude or semi-nude model and in no time at all she's making as much as $200 . 00 a day when she's working on a photo shoot . Cory seeing the results of his girlfriend Pauleen's work , the nude photos , breaks up with her and leaves for Bannon leaving Pauleen alone in the big city with almost no one to turn to for help . Slowly getting corrupted by drugs as well as posing nude and later appearing and acting in porno flicks the truth about Pauleen's sudden descent into the dark abyss of the world of adult entertainment reaches her parents and friends back in Bannon Kansas . This shocking discovery of Pauleens not so secret life happens as she appears in a number of nude and explicate girlie magazines and XXX rated movies and videos on sale in and around Bannon . The movie "" Shattered Innocence "" is very realistic in the fact that not all was bad and depressing for young Paulleen . We see her having good times at high class parties with famous Hollywood producers directors and actors in attendance . Pauleen did in the brief time that she was involved in the porno business have more then her share of fame & success , earning herself a nomination as best porno actress of 1983 at the yearly Erotic Film Awards . As a top rated and much sought after Porno Queen , making as much as 30 feature films , Pauleen made more then enough money to get her out of the business and start a new life . It was Pauleens strong addicting to cocaine that she stuck up her nose almost around the clock in order to keep her weight down and give her a high that ate up all her savings , as much as $1 , 500 . 00 a day when she was shooting a movie . It was when her cocaine supplier and live-in boyfriend Mel , John Pleshette , was sent away to the big house for five years on an old drug rap that pushed Pauleen to the edge and also drove the depressed confused and abandoned young woman to kill herself . All too common a story about how the glamor and glitter of tinsel town drove many a young girl to her doom finding out only too late that the odds of making it big , no matter how gorgeous and beautiful she is , on the big or small screen is about as high as the dead coming back to life before the resurrection . Even if Pauleen , by some miracle , did make it to stardom and fame , without being addicted to drugs , in almost all cases it would last about as long as a flickering shooting star across the sky on a warm summer night ; Like the short and sad life of of the beautiful but tragic Pauleen Anderson AKA Colleen Applegate .","SPOILERS Getting killed on the golf course by a loose ball stock broker Sterling Brooks , Cameron Bancroft , ends of in this heavenly way-station where it's to be decided , by a Heavenly Counsel , where and what his final destination will be ; Heaven or that other place . This will be decided on in what actions Sterling takes when he goes back on earth when he's to correct the mistakes he made while he was still alive . Being guided by his Guardian Angle Joe , Greg Evlgan , Sterling will find out that his mission is to save both Annie Campbell , Erika Elenika , and her daughter Marissa , Nickol Tschenscher , from the notorious Badgett Brothers Junior & Eddie , Eli Gabry & Craig March . It's Junior Badgett whom Amie is slated to testify against in an arson an attempted murder case that she's the only witness to . It takes a while for Sterling to get the hang of being dead as well as invisible to those , like Amie and Marissa , back on earth . It takes even longer for the not that on the ball , in realizing what his relationship is with both Amie & Nickol , Sterling to throw off his hang ups , like disliking kids , and realize that he lived a life of nihilism and self absorption not feeling or caring for those whom he hurt in the process . As Sterling starts to connect with both Amie & Marissa he not only finds his long lost humanity for his fellow human being but becomes visible to both of them . As all this is happening Marissa feeling left out , by being locked up in her home for her own protection , in the world sneaks out of her mom's and granny's , Norah Campbell , house to go ice-skating with her friends . Spotted by Eddie Badgett and his henchmen they end up kidnapping Marissa holding her hostage in that it will persuade her mom not to testify against his brother Junior in court . That all had to do with Amie , who was the singer at a party thrown by the Badgett's , overhearing Junior brag about torching Hans Kramer's , Udo Kler , home-which he later did-in retaliation for Hans being late on a loan that he owed him . As if burning down Hans house wasn't enough Junior also plans to murder him after he gets his money from Hans in order , in him being a notorious loan shark , just to keep in practice ! If Amie testifies in court to what she heard Junior say he'll be put on ice , or the clink , for the rest of his miserable life ! It's now up to Sterling to rescue Marissa from the Badgett Mob and thus have her mom feel safe in testifying against Junior Badgett . As things turn out it's not Sterling who ends up saving the day but someone else who , like Sterling , came back from the "" other side "" to straighten things out . And that more then anything else will not only save both Marissa and , if it's possible to save someone's life who's dead already , Sterling lives but turn the murderous Badgett Brothers , or at lest Eddie , into decent and law abiding citizens ! A lot like the 1946 classic Christmas movie "" It's a Wounderful Life "" the 2002 made for TV film "" He Sees You when You're Sleeping "" hits all the right notes in its giving Sterling another chance in redeeming himself so he can be accepted as an angle in heaven . As for Guardian Angle Joe he's still hard at work with saving other persons assigned to him in having them clear up the messes they left on earth after they passed away ! But now Joe has fellow Guardian Angle Sterling Brooks to help him out with his heavy workload .",2721657,2721657,True
156,"The Five Pennies Danny Kaye plays Red Nichols , a famous coronet player of yesteryear . I found this story a notch better "" fair "" and nicely aided by the musical talent of Louis Armstrong . Kaye and Armstrong's duet on "" When The Saints Go Marching In "" is the highlight of the film . For a classic movie , the stereo in here is amazing , especially on the songs . In one instance , there are three people singing and their voices all coming out separately on different speakers . Pretty good for just the tape . Now that a DVD has been released , I wonder what the sound on that is like ? The story starts to lag a bit near the end when Kaye starts to feel sorry for himself and this goes on and on as he retires from playing . However , there is a nice , sentimental upbeat ending . Notes : Kaye and Barbara Bel Geddes , who plays Red's wife "" Bobbie , "" never age in the film even though it spans 15 or more years ! It's interesting to see Tuesday Weld as a teenager .","It's not a movie with a great or original story ( which horror movie does anyway ? ) or approach but this is simply one fine and effective genre movie , with a fine premise , good settings and some wonderful genre moments . Amazing thing is that director Bob Clark started his career with movies like this but soon continued on making movies such as "" Porky's "" and "" Baby Geniuses "" , which is obviously a totally different genre . A waste of his talent ? Well , in all honesty horror movies from the ' 70's are definitely better ones than the ones from the ' 80's of ' 90's , so I'm not too sure about it actually if Clark would had continued to direct horror movies during his later career those movies would had been as good as this one , mostly in terms of style . ' 70's movies of course have a very distinctive style and atmosphere . Some of the best and most classic horror movies also date back from the ' 70's . Movies such as "" The Exorcist "" , "" The Omen "" , "" Don't Look Now "" , "" Halloween "" oh and I can just go on and on . This movie wasn't the first slasher and it also wasn't the most influential or best known one ( credit for that still mostly goes to John Carpenter's "" Halloween "" ) but it's nevertheless obvious that this movie inspired later film-makers and is a fine example of the genre from the ' 70's . It's a really effective horror movie , that features all of the right required ingredients . It doesn't make this the most original genre movie with its style or approach but it's simply one fine executed one . The movie has a good dark and mysterious atmosphere and it also really knows to be scary in parts . Especially the phone calls within the movie , which play a key part , are really scary . I don't know what it is but phone calls are always scary and effective material for horror movies . Just think about movies such as "" Scream "" , "" When a Stranger Calls "" or "" Sorry , Wrong Number "" . What also helps the movie is its atmospheric musical score from Carl Zittrer , who used to work a lot with Bob Clark during his career . The movie also really has a great cast with actors you wouldn't necessarily normally expect in a genre movie such as this one . Margot Kidder is really great in this movie , in a fairly early role from her . The movie also stars Keir Dullea , who unfortunately doesn't ever star in that many movies . A great movie for the fans of the genre , as well as to everyone else for all that matter .",4445210,1416505,False
157,"This movie is in constant rotation on SciFi and its another one of those movies that I stop at each time its on . The plot has badly done giant mosquitoes attacking people in the country side . They have been mutated after feeding on the blood of dead aliens . . . I know you're shocked , you were expecting a high class movie ( even with the title Mosquito ) and instead you got a very silly movie played ( reasonably ) straight by everyone involved . Clearly the cast and crew knew this was a silly idea , but they milk it for all its worth turning the attack scenes into something you both wince at ( for the idea of it ) and groan at ( the silliness of the execution ) . This is one of the rare modern attempts at a drive in movie that walks the fine line between being serious and being mocking to create something thats enjoyable despite the dumbness of it all . If you can take it on its own level its worth two bags of popcorn and a couple of sodas . If you can't take it for what it it is then you're in for a long painful viewing experience . on the brain dead fun-o-meter .","If you want to see a hysterical but incredibly mindless film this is it .

158,"Having won multiple awards and gotten itself nominated in the 2002 Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category , my interest in Lagaan was actually in wanting to discover more of writer-director Ashutosh Gowariker's works , having seen his latest movie Jodha Akbar , and having bought Swades : We , the People starring Shah Rukh Khan , still unwatched . I've never been a fan of cricket and have never understood the rules , but I suppose after the time you're through with Lagaan , you'll learn at least the basics enough to enjoy the game . No doubt my interest in this sport has been piqued , and non-fans shouldn't steer away from the movie , because knowledge of the sport is not a pre-requisite for you to enjoy this wonderful gem of a sports movie running close to a whopping 3 . 5 hours ( and I heard in the collector's edition , it runs to 4 ? ) Set in British India , we learn that Lagaan is a form of taxation that the villagers have to pay to their Rajas , who in turn pay the British for protection against , erm , invading forces and rivals from other Rajas . In fact , the British were double crossing everyone during their occupation of the country , and bad weather makes the lives of the villagers even more hard pressed since they have zero crops to sell . Every village needs a folk hero , and herein lies Bhuvan ( Aamir Khan ) who decides to step into the shoes of one , not because of bravado , but because of the atrocities dished out by the British against his fellow countrymen , especially when taxes for the year have been doubled . So the stakes are raised in a game of cricket . Defeat the British , led by Captain Andrew Russell ( Paul Blackthorne ) and have a tax waver of 3 years for the entire province , or if they lose , then their Lagaan will be tripled . And you don't need a rocket scientist to tell you that when the impoverished have their backs against the corner , they have little choice but to fight back . However , after years of being oppressed and cowering in the face of hardship , you'll need that bright spark or two to shake things up and bring everyone to their senses that Hope is something they have which they can turn into reality if they work at it . The storyline might seem cliché as per the usual sports movies , where our hero Bhuvan has to assemble a team of good men each with their own special farming background which can be incorporated into the game , and recruitment always is a challenge when nobody believes you , and thinks you're the troublemaker who started it all . There are leaders , and there are followers , and some good time is invested to develop this challenge , as well as to explore the plight of the villagers in more detail . The villains of the movie , those pompous Brits personified by Captain Russell with his nose perpetually in the air all the time , are put in very bad light with their looking down of the natives as slaves . But even amongst themselves , the Indians too have their infamous caste system , and this was touched upon when Bhuvan chooses to adopt the more meritocratic route in player selection , and this message undoubtedly stands out . I can't comment much on these themes that Gowariker touch upon in his films , such as that of religious tolerance in Jodha Akbar , but it seems likely that he had incorporated these knowing that his films do appeal to the masses , and therefore serve as a reminder to everyone . While the last 1 . 5 hours get devoted to the game , where two proud man go head to head against each other with their team , and team members having their own personal vendettas worked out during the matches , it never for a minute played out in a boring manner . In fact , it was entertaining to watch them go through the paces of the game in 101 terms , and from there , those unfamiliar with cricket will likely be able to pick up the basics . Even if the sport is not your cup of tea , its delivery will still appeal to you , as do the usual Bollywood staple of dance and song , as composed by renowned A . R . Rahman - I particularly liked the segment where any self-respective sports movie will have - the training montage , and with a love triangle of sorts fused between Bhuvan , his childhood sweetheart Gauri ( Gracy Singh ) and Englishwoman Elizabeth Russell ( Rachel Shelley ) , sister of the villagers ' enemy but one who decides to teach them the game so that they can get on equal terms with her countrymen . Despite its clichés , Lagaan is wonderful entertainment , and you will not realize the movie's running length , as you'll be engrossed in what transpires , and will find yourself rooting for the clear underdogs as they go about trying to battle oppression in unfamiliar terms . Colourful songs and charismatic folk characters , Lagaan unquestionably reinforces my love for Bollywood !","Sixth or seven go round for the "" classic "" tale from the pen of the creator of Charlie Chan about a writer who goes to a deserted inn to write a story in 24 hours ( on a bet ) only to have interruption after interruption as people show up , guns are fired , secret doors open and bodies fall . It was a creaky tale ( George M Cohan was doing a stage version in 1913 ) when this film was made which may explain the slightly jokey tone , personified by the leads knowing nod and a wink way of acting . I like the story and I've seen a couple of other versions of the tale , and I find that when its done right you forget that you know what's going on and lose yourself in the telling . Unfortunately here the ability to lose myself was diminished by direction that didn't seem to want to really play up the mystery elements , despite great sets and a lead that signaled he knew what was going on . There was no way I was going to forget I knew how this was all coming out . Its not a bad film , but unless you've never seen any version of the story before you're more than likely to be extremely unimpressed . Worth a look , more so for those who don't know the tale ( if you know it wait until you're in a high tolerance mood )",317399,3079504,False

160,"This 2002 Japanese film is the third feature film showcased in the inaugural Singapore Fantastic Film Festival ( The first two being Kontroll and Immortel , which I should be able to watch by the end of the fest ) . 9 Souls is at times a complex movie , and at times one which has a simple tale to tell . It blurs and crosses the line so often , it makes it difficult to try and classify its genre - part gore , part comedy , part social commentary . The title refers to 9 prisoners , who are introduced in more detail during their escape from prison ( in a very creative introduction by the way ) , ranging from murderers to a porn king , from a juvenile delinquent to a vertically challenged escape artist . It turns into part comedy once they escape , and have to find the means and substinence to help keep themselves alive in a strange new world . Prior to their escape , their world is their prison cell , rudely interrupted by a tenth crazed prisoner , a counterfeit king who leaks out the secret to the whereabouts of his stash . With this bit of information , they embark on a quest to recover this lost promise of treasure before going their separate ways . Which forms the second half of the movie . Throughout the first half , we are exposed to the dreams and hopes of these escape convicts . Being locked up for some time , they each have a secret desire to either reunite with their loved one , or have plans to live a better life . At some point , you will ponder if it was wise of them to each seek their dream , knowing its dire consequences , or would rather choose to stick together in their new found family . Thoughts on second chances in life also crosses your mind , if these serious crime offenders deserve another break in life , or are forever condemned in the eyes of society for their one moment of folly which has kept them locked up . The pacing of the film is at times choppy , and you'd have scenes that come out of the blue ( like cross-dressing as a disguise ) . I heard quite a number of people around me give the "" hmm . . . where did that come from "" comment . The soundtrack is kept simple , to a constantly played guitar tune , which in scenes of peace are kept soft , and in scenes of angst , being played to a crescendo . I find this effective in conveying emotions in the film , without the need of a bloated soundtrack . Rated R21 here for its subject content and scenes of gore which is not really shown on screen , this film is recommended for those who seek a different film offering , which is what this film fest is striving to achieve .","With this Speedy cartoon , almost everything just clicks . This is one of the better ones made in the 1960s . Sylvester is an excellent choice as a foil for Speedy and Speedy , who is really kind of bland when you think about it a bit , actually is kind of interesting in this one . Though the best Speedys have an ancillary character that makes the cartoon special ( like Slowpoke Rodriguez , for example ) this one is good enough without one to be memorable .

A movie about a robot who may have committed murder focuses mostly on Will Smith's character . He does pretty good in the role , but I am thinking an older actor would have done a better job with the role , maybe a Bruce Willis or someone like that . Still Smith did better than I thought he would and his character was believable enough for me . The robots are very well done and the story is decent enough , though I think they could have trimmed it down maybe ten or so minutes .

He will explain in depth a conversation between actors in the movie . I am guessing they messed up the recording of the voices when filming and instead of getting all the actors and actresses back to rerecord they probably figured it would be cheaper to get a narrator . Then there is the monster . A monster so slow ( it does creep , you have to give it that ) that you wonder how anyone can be killed by it . You virtually have to stay in one place and wait for it to kill you . I am guessing there is a city ordinance in the town against running . And , of course , it looks bad too .

163,"I so wanted to give this film a better review , because if nothing else , "" Hulk "" at least takes a more interesting than average approach to the comic - book - turned - into - summer - blockbuster genre . Ang Lee gets kudos from me for his use of split screens to suggest the panels of a comic book , but that's about where my praise ends . Because I usually like Lee , I'm giving this two stars instead of one , but I'm doing that under duress . "" Hulk "" is dreadful . It's 140 minutes of nonsense , which might be o . k . if that nonsense had any notion that it was nonsense . But Lee and company seem to take their material utterly seriously , which is deadly for this kind of film . Lee uses the comic book look for his film , but he doesn't use the comic book tongue-in-cheek style of story-telling , so every single scene comes across as unintentionally silly . Even with that , the film might have been enjoyable . Hey , I enjoy a fun bad movie as much as the next guy . But this is a fun bad movie without the fun . The story takes forever to get going , and once it does it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway . I can't believe I'm saying this , but this is one case where the story overwhelms the visuals . I don't really need that much back story to the Hulk - - - what I want are cool action sequences and zingy special effects . Well , the effects in this suck . I almost have to believe the CG animation in this film was intentionally corny , otherwise the producers got seriously ripped off . The only thing I can say about the animated Hulk is that he's a better actor than Eric Bana , who plays Bruce Banner . Please don't ask this boy to act , and especially don't ask him to cry . Jennifer Connelly is starting to really get on my nerves . She's stealing the market on noble suffering away from Joan Allen . But the real booby prize goes to Nick Nolte , who has driven another nail into the coffin of his career with his appearance in this . He's absolutely putrid , chewing the scenery every chance he gets in a greasy fright wig . His big showy soliloquy toward the end might have been more effective if the viewer could understand a word he says , but I doubt it . Perhaps the filmmakers should have chosen to use a CG version of Nick Nolte instead of the real thing .

The film feeds off of Americans ' nostalgic and sentimental attitudes about the sport , and it boasts a shamelessly manipulative ending custom made to wring tears from its audience , but damned if it doesn't work .",4532636,4532636,True

A highlight is his impersonation of some Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin routines . Frankly , I didn't care for the rest of the lead characters , those played by Aiden Quinn ( too blasphemous ) and Mary Stuart Masterson ( nice at first , but then pouts all the time which gets tiresome ) .

This is where we see a little bit of Radu's weakness and that he can have mortal feelings for another , even love . Weither or not he's in love with Michelle , I think he admires her innocence and beauty , the power she holds over him , she knows it and definitely takes advantage of it , who can blame her , right ? But I love how the story goes into Radu , he fears this emotion , understandably , and it blinds him . This is strangely a tragic love story that really intrigues me , it goes from teacher / student to love / hate . Radu though I promise still delivers the good scares like the other Subspecies movies . Radu and his student , Michelle , are up to a lot , while he teaches her what it means to be a vampire , Radu's mother thinks it's a bad idea to keep her . Michelle's sister , Morgan , will not give up and she will do anything to save her sister's should . Michelle tells Radu that she can never love him , that she hates him and would rather just die instead of being a vampire but Radu wishes for her to stay with him forever . Bloodlust : Subspecies III is just continuing where the second Subspecies left off . My favorite scene was where Michelle is outside and Radu comes from behind her and she asks what can kill them , the dialog he delivers as well as his expressions , for a low budget film , Anders Hove is a good actor and makes Radu very believable . The scene was beautifully done between him and Denise . This was a fun series to get into , I really have enjoyed it , these are the horror films I've been looking for and would highly recommend them for a good scare .",4445210,1293485,False

166,"The print I saw was a very worn black and white one from Sinister Cinema and as the film went on it rapidly became clear that the print's lack of quality and color work against real enjoyment of the film .

She soon commits suicide rather than be taken prisoner , but does so only after getting the baby away . The baby ends up being raised by lions . Years later the adult Ursus ends up captured by the evil king who killed his parents and moves to prevent him from ever taking the throne . There's more to it than that but it at least gives you the basic idea of the plot .

167,"Carousel  , the musical , was presented on Broadway with great success . The transition to the screen , alas , doesn't fare that well . Having seen this film version a while ago , we decided to take a second look , but this time , in all honesty , it didn't have the same effect . Partly , it must be Henry King's take on the musical . Perhaps it this Rodgers and Hammerstein hasn't aged that well . The problem , perhaps , seems to be in the music . We have heard variations of these Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs in other musicals . Take for instance , "" You'll Never Walk Alone "" , doesn't it sound suspiciously like "" Climb Every Mountain "" from "" The Sound of Music "" ? In both cases , they are heard from much older and wiser women , Cousin Nettie , in this one , or Mother Superior in the other . Also there are shades of "" Some Enchanting Evening "" , from "" South Pacific "" , while Louise is seen playing around at the beach while Billy is looking from heaven . Of course , we realize "" Carousel "" came before . One wonders what change of events took Billy Bigelow to heaven ? After all , he wasn't a model of righteousness , let alone his way of giving Julie a slap or two at times . If all indicates that he was admitted through the Pearly Gates of heaven , then , there's a chance for most of us , or so , it seems to be the case . Gordon McRae was more of a singer than an actor , and it sadly shows in this film . The lovely Shirley Jones , at the prime of her youth , fares much better because she could not only sing , but she was a notable actress of this genre and comedy . For some reason , the chemistry that might have existed between them in "" Oklahoma "" , is not shown here . Cameron Mitchell , Gene Lockhart , Claramae Turner , Susan Luckey , among others do good supporting jobs in the film . The choreography of Agnes de Mille is only seen in all its splendor in "" June is busting out all over "" and in the Carousel ballet , somehow abridged , and featuring Jacques D'Amboise with Louis Luckey in one of the best moments of the musical .","Michael Blakemore's "" Country Life "" is loosely based on Chekhov's "" Uncle Vanya "" . Mr . Blakemore , a distinguished theater director , and actor , takes us to his native Australia , where he sets the story circa 1919 . It's a time where Aussie soldiers are returning home from WWI . We watch as Alexander Voysey , who has been living abroad , returning with his new wife , Deborah , to the estate in the country where his daughter and brother-in-law are living . Voysey is a snob who seems out of place in the house that has seen better days . His young wife Deborah , is with him because obviously she needs a meal ticket . Uncle Jack , has stayed behind doing all the thankless jobs , helped by his niece Sally , who is Alexander's daughter . We also see the free thinking doctor Max Askey , whose ideas clash with the conservative town folks . It seems inevitable , but Deborah and the doctor develop a passion for one another that comes to nothing , while young Sally who secretly loves the older doctor , doesn't stand a chance with him . Ultimately , the Voyseys have had it with the place and when Alexander's plans to sell the estate to neighbors fail because Jack's protests and animosity toward his brother-in-law , who by now , we realize is a fake , decide to go west in search of greener pastures . "" Country Life "" is a film where we draw parallels between its Russian model and the Aussie setting . All the elements of Chekhov are there beautifully staged and directed by Michael Blakemore . The distinguished cast acts well as an ensemble under Mr . Blakemore's direction . Googie Withers makes a good contribution as the crusty cook Hannah , who knows all the secrets of the family .

168,"Midsomer Murders : Four Funerals and a Wedding is set in the small village of Broughton in which a feud between the sexes has divided the village since Word War One , the feud has been passed down the generations where the pro-feminist female side call themselves the Skimmington's while the misogynistic males call themselves the Rider's . Mildred Danvers ( Ann Morrish ) returns to Broughton after several decades for the funeral of her one time close friend Vivienne Marwood . It's the day of the annual Skimmington Fayre & DCI Tom Barnaby ( John Nettles ) has been dragged along by his wife Joyce ( Jane Wymark ) & his mother-in-law Muriel ( Daphne Oxenford ) only to called into official action when Mildred is found dead in her hotel room . Barnaby suspects foul play & when later in the day local Rev . Anthony Gant ( Richard McCabe ) is shot in the head & murdered during a Donkey race ( ! ) Barnaby has a double homicide on his hands . . . Episode 5 from season 9 this Midsomer Murders mystery was directed by Sarah Hellings & is a pretty decent episode although I found it a little silly at times & isn't up there with the series classics . The title Four Funerals and a Wedding is obviously a pun on the smash-hit British comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral ( 1994 ) & as the title suggests there are four death's although ( only one funeral is shown ) & a wedding at the end of a fairly by-the-numbers Midsomer Murders episode , it isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination but if I had the choice to watch any Midsomer Murders episode again I doubt very much I would pick Four Funerals and a Wedding . It starts off quite good with a couple of quick fire murders & yet another comic relief subplot about Barnaby's in-law including an amusing one where someone is shot through the head while riding a Donkey ! The killer's motives are alright & the back-story is decent too although I don't understand why they didn't kill Dr . O'Dowd when they had the chance & when he clearly saw them & therefore identify them to the police , I am not sure if it was meant to be obvious why they didn't kill the doc but if it was it passed me by . I wasn't too keen on the silly plot about Broughton being divided into two separate feuding factions , a bunch of guy's against some ladies just seemed a little whimsical to me . As usual there is lots of exposition & dialogue so you need to concentrate & have patience with it , those with a short attention span need not bother with it . Four Funerals and a Wedding is one of those Midsomer Murders episodes which features a village fête , I must admit I have lived in England all my life & have never seen a village fête in reality & I am starting to wonder whether this staple film & telly cliché is just that . There are three murders although two are off screen with the third not showing anything graphic . Filmed in Buckinghamshire the photography is as nice as usual & the production values are high . The acting is pretty good although no-one stands out particularly . Four Funerals and a Wedding is a good solid Midsomer Murders episode that features a decent body count & a reasonable plot but a slightly silly premise & an overall feeling that it's no more than average ultimately prevents it from being regarded as a classic in my mind .","I saw this very amusing film in October 2007 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone ; the annual festival has made a welcome return to that town after eight years in nearby Sacile . . . a town no less beautiful , but in Sacile the festival's programme was split between two smaller cinemas at opposite ends of the town , thus forcing me ( and other attendees ) to hustle back and forth from one screening to another . The print screened at Pordenone was loaned by collector Martin Starewitch - - a French-born grandson of the film's Polish-born director - - restored from a ( silent ) nitrate print in Nederlands Filmmuseum . ' The Little Parade ' undoubtedly delighted French audiences when it was first released in 1928 , not least for its title . . . coming soon after the European release of MGM's huge hit ' The Big Parade ' . Six weeks after its original French release , a second version of ' The Little Parade ' was released with a synchronised audio track of sound effects . Here we have a ' trick ' film , and of course anyone familiar with silent films will at once be put in mind of Georges Melies , the master of early cinema trickery . However , Melies's films relied very heavily on the jump cut , which enabled objects and people to vanish , appear and instantaneously change positions in the frame . ' The Little Parade ' relies on a larger repertory of cinema illusions . Also , there's more story in this film than in a typical Melies short : ' The Little Parade ' is adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale ' The Steadfast Tin Soldier ' . Mirrors are cleverly used here to make the actors on screen seem magically to multiply , so that one soldier becomes a vast platoon . One of the annoying things about the sound revolution that changed cinema was the fact that audiences were so eager for sound that ANY movie which talked ( no matter how bad it was otherwise ) became far more profitable for exhibitors than any film which didn't talk ( such as this one ) even if it included sound effects . ' The Little Parade ' had the misfortune to be made just before the talkies changed everything , and consequently this delightful movie ( along with many other wonderful silents ) was swept out of the public consciousness and into oblivion . Fortunately , it has now been restored . I'll rate ' The Little Parade ' . It's an excellent film which owes nothing ( except its title ) to King Vidor's ' The Big Parade ' , but when a movie has a parody title I can't quite bring myself to consider it the equal of the film which its parodic title is based upon . . . and ' The Big Parade ' is a definite .",1355507,1609079,False

The biggest laughs in this satire comes from Ellen Barkin , who played Durst's trailer-trash mom and mom's friend Loretta ( Allison Janney ) . They both had incredibly fake Minnesota accents . Adding to the laughs was the fact that just about everyone in this film smoke and drank constantly - not what you would expect at a teen pageant . Supporting was Sin City's Brittany Murphy and Matt Malloy as a sleazy judge . I know I will leave out some other fine performers as there were too many to mention .

Ben Stiller is unfunny , and the rest of the cast are uninspired . Even Sarah Jessica Parker , who usually makes even the least entertaining film passable . The clichés are all there : best friends who should be together but can't see it , the main guy is infatuated with someone who doesn't know that he exists , etc .

Both of the main characters are annoying and at times despicable , so I suppose they fit together quite nicely . One final criticism : why is it , that no Hollywood film can contain a favorable of an artist , particularly a painter ? Here he's presented as a childish , eccentric moron . Is that supposed to be funny ? Final thought : only reason to see this film is to see the young and ( already then ) talented actress Scarlett Johansson in a very little role as a young child .

The big five are Jason Robards , Jr . , Charles Bickford , Kevin McCarthy , Robert Middleton , and John Qualen . After the game gets going with the whole town just hanging on word of every hand , a very tired trio of pilgrims , Henry Fonda , Joanne Woodward , and their child Gerald Michenaud arrive in town . They are a sorry trio , especially Fonda who would be a candidate for Gamblers Anonymous if such a thing existed in 1900 . Fonda just asks if he could watch , kind of like Arthur O'Connell who hasn't got the price of favors at the bordello in There Was A Crooked Man , but the madam allows him a little fun at the keyhole for old time's sake . Kevin McCarthy is the one who takes pity on him and in fact this is the first but not the last time he shows gallantry as a true Southern gentleman . A Big Hand For The Little Lady is a film that's almost impossible to write about without giving away anything . I absolutely dare not go any further in talking about it . But what A Big Hand For The Little Lady is is that it is a really original idea for a western comedy that I defy anyone to watch without enjoying it . It's not got the rough house type humor that Burt Kennedy or John Ford do in their films , but there are laughs a plenty . This film turned out to be the farewell appearance on the big screen for Charles Bickford one of the best and most durable character actors the screen ever saw . He's kind of subdued in the film , my guess is that health problems were starting to overtake him . Still he fits the gruff part he has perfectly .

174,"I should declare a personal interest here : the Austrian film ' The Grinning Face ' is based on one of my all-time favourite novels , ' The Man Who Laughs ' by Victor Hugo . How much of a favourite is it ? Well , the protagonist of this novel is named Gwynplaine ( Hugo's imperfect attempt at creating a British name ) . When I first encountered this novel in my adolescence , I found Gwynplaine's exploits so inspiring that I took his name as my own middle name , changing my name legally by deed poll . Anyone reading this page is likely to know that Paul Leni directed a very impressive film version of ' The Man Who Laughs ' in Hollywood , at the very end of the silent era , starring the brilliant actor Conrad Veidt . That movie made several changes to Hugo's novel ( including the addition of a happy ending ) , but on the whole it's an excellent film with superb production values and a brilliant central performance by Veidt . This earlier Austrian version sticks closer to Hugo's novel . . . which isn't entirely a point in this film's favour , as Hugo's novel has a rambling plot that places too much attention on peripheral characters , most of whom should have been deleted altogether . Linnaeus Clancharlie ( how's that for an Englishman's name ? ) is a baron in the British peerage . He's also the Marquis of Corleone in Sicily , but he'd rather live in England and be a baron instead of being a marquis in Sicily , even though a marquis is three rungs higher up the peerage . In 1682 , Clancharlie incurs the displeasure of King James the Second . . . who has the baron murdered . The king also orders the murder of the baron's young son and heir , two-year-old Fermain . But the corrupt Doctor Hardquanonne sells the boy to some bandits , who mutilate Fermain's face so that they can exhibit him at funfairs . They carve his mouth into a permanent grin . Years later , in the reign of Queen Anne , the mutilated boy - - who has no knowledge of his noble birthright - - is now the young man Gwynplaine , manly of figure and presumably handsome of face except for the mutilation of his cake-hole . Gwynplaine lives with Ursus , a travelling mountebank who sells folk remedies . Their jolly family is completed by Dea , a beautiful foundling who is blind . She is passionately in love with Gwynplaine , all unaware of his deformity . Whenever Dea passes her fingers across Gwynplaine's disfigured face , she assumes he must be happy because of his broad grin . But meanwhile , under torture in Queen Anne's dungeon , Hardquanonne has confessed Gwynplaine's birthright . . . This film presents a fairly straightforward and simplified retelling of Hugo's novel . Comparisons to the Leni version are inevitable , so here goes : although the Leni film had superb production values , its depiction of early 18th-century England was not especially convincing . ( I still cringe when I recall the Ferris wheel in the funfair sequences . ) This Austrian film was made on a far lower budget , but the costumes and sets are vastly more convincing than in Leni's version . Leni's film boasts the splendidly sensitive performance of Conrad Veidt , and several excellent supporting performances . In this Austrian ' pre-make ' , most of the actors are dull and stolid . The actor who plays Lord Dirry-Moir should have been deleted from this movie altogether . One exception is Nora Gregor as Princess Josiana , the jaded heiress who is attracted to Gwynplaine precisely because of his deformity . Gregor makes it clear that Josiana is sexually aroused by Gwynplaine's deformity ; the Leni remake was very close-mouthed on this subject . In the central role of Gwynplaine , Franz Höbling possesses barely a fraction of Conrad Veidt's electrifying presence and sensual virility . Höbling is further handicapped by a wretched makeup job simulating the mutilation of his face . In his own performance as Gwynplaine , Veidt expertly rose to the challenge of being unable to use the lower half of his face to convey emotion , skilfully employing his eyes and his hands to convey emotions that radically contradicted the broad grin on his face . Höbling is simply unable to do justice to a role that requires him to keep his mouth immobile . As the blind heroine Dea , Lucienne Delacroix is a disaster , but I shan't blame the actress for this . One of the weak points of Hugo's novel is that Dea is really a compendium of frailties rather than a fully realised human being . She resembles those doomed Victorian heroines - - Little Nell , Eva St Claire - - who exist for the sole purpose of dying tragically young . That's how Delacroix plays the role here . Unlike Leni's version , this Austrian movie retains the tragic ending of Hugo's original novel : Dea abruptly dies at sea , and Gwynplaine flings himself overboard to a watery grave . I enjoyed ' The Grinning Face ' , but I'm prejudiced in its favour . In a few aspects , it actually surpasses the Leni film . But , on a point-for-point basis , there's no question that the Leni version is superior . I'll rate ' The Grinning Face ' .","Apart from my obvious love of the sci-fi genre ? and particularly those films produced during its Golden Age of the 1950s ? this film held the added attraction of being directed by Czech émigré Edgar G . Ulmer who was later dubbed "" King Of The B's "" for the DVD generation . His other genre entries include the exceptional THE BLACK CAT ( 1934 ) , BLUEBEARD ( 1944 ) , the delirious DAUGHTER OF DR . JEKYLL ( 1957 ) , BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER ( 1960 ) , THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN ( 1960 ) and L ' ATLANTIDE ( 1961 ) . Visitors from another planet ( in this case landing in Scotland , of all places ) were very much in evidence on cinema screens at the time and comparing this one to two others that were released contemporaneously ? THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD ? doesn't do it any favors at all . Shot in fog-bound settings to disguise its low budget origins , the material here does not even seem to have inspired the director much either since his trademark visual style ( which elevated a handful of potboilers to cult status ) is hardly visible . What the film has going for it is a likable hero ( an American journalist ) , a shady scientist who ( in a hilarious scene ) thinks nothing of beating the alien to a pulp to get him to impart his superior scientific knowledge and , unfortunately , one of the lamest aliens ever to land on this planet ; described in the film's tagline as "" The WEIRDEST visitor the Earth has ever seen ! "" , his Humpty Dumpty-visage and Harry Langdon-mannerisms certainly give credence to such hyperbole ! As usual with such fare , there is a moral to be found at the end of it but what I found most interesting here is that the alien takes over the humans and engages them as his slaves to repair his spaceship ? two years before IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE ! Incidentally , co-screenwriter Jack Pollexfen also had a hand in such equally cheap but irresistible genre fare as THE SON OF DR . JEKYLL ( 1951 ) , CAPTIVE WOMEN ( 1952 ) , THE NEANDERTHAL MAN ( 1953 ) , the aforementioned DAUGHTER OF DR . JEKYLL and MONSTROSITY aka THE ATOMIC BRAIN ( 1964 ) !",1609079,1399158,False

Paul Newman does a fine performance ( although I'd go watch Paul Newman read the Uniform Code of Military Justice ) but it is an ensemble film and the performances of just about the entire cast fairly dance off one another , particularly the principal players . Jessica Tandy , in one of her last performances , gives a magnificent effort and the interplay between she and Newman is perfect . Bruce Willis plays Newman's foil , part friend , part rival and Melanie Griffith gives one of the best performances of her career .

Very much Recommended .","While the cartoon does have a dated feel to it in spots , the animation is excellent ( a Disney strength during the 1930s ) and it still largely works for the most part , although probably not as well for the age group raised on jump-cut , fast-pace edits and Matrix style special effects .

This is clearly the director's homage to his beautiful mother , which probably was the reason this film was made . The screen play by the director and Helen Caldwell , doesn't translate to a good film , as we watch the finished product . Mr . Casavettes ' heart is in the right place , but the movie , as written , doesn't make much sense . First of all , one wonders where Mildred went wrong . Her daughter Annie is a mess . Her son , the yuppie , lives in his own material world . We would like to think Mildred and her late husband created a nice environment for these two children . They both turned out to be losers in their own right . Mildred's neighbors don't belong in her neighborhood . One wonders how the probably low wage earner , Monica , can live across the street from Mildred's better than average home . A lady like Mildred would probably have told Monica off from the beginning . The way Monica curses in every sentence would have been a turn off factor for Mildred . Of course , we know she goes along because suddenly she has found the sweet little J . J . that Monica dumps on her . Monica and Mildred live in two different worlds and it's hard for us to accept their situation because Monica shows no redeeming qualities , except the love for her son . Mildred , on the other hand , doesn't have a clue about how to reach out for her daughter . The only positive thing Mildred does is to sell the house and go into a new life . Miami in her future ? The other thing that doesn't make sense is to watch the elegant Mildred going to the dive where Monica takes her to drink . Big Tommy's interest in her , while it might be sexual , is not fully realized either because they stick out like oil and vinegar . There is no chemistry between Mildred and this big French Canadian guy . Gena Rowlands does an excellent job as Mildred . She is always serene and composed . That's why Marisa Tomei over acting , the way she does , looks completely out of place , next to Mildred . Jake Lloyd is sweet and not bratty as J . J . , the boy who loves Mildred until his father comes back home . Moira Kelly's Annie is an enigma . David Sherrill and Bridgette Wilson play Mildred's son and daughter-in-law . Poor Gerard Depardieu , a great star in his native France , doesn't have a thing to show for himself . M . Depardieu should choose more carefully his future films in America ! With the exception of "" She's so Lovely "" , which reminded us more of his father's influence , and "" John Q "" , Nick Casavettes hasn't made a name for himself as of yet .

Now , they have graduated in this 1940 version and they're still up to their necks in all sorts of chicanery . With the exception of Henry O'Neill , all the main players of the original version repeated their roles 2 years later . Perhaps , since we got used to what they carried on at the military academy , we have become immune to their antics in the sequel . Jane Wyman , with those thick glasses , showed she had some comic ability , especially in her drunk scene . This picture again belongs to Wayne Morris , as the scheming guy who involves Ronald Reagan and Eddie Albert into a variety of messy situations .

178,"How could one not at least try and watch a big , bulky western yarn where Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood play prospectors who are not only married to the same woman but , yes , sing . Lots of singing . And surrounded by enough extras to give someone a hemorrhage . I did try and watch it , and got through it pretty much unscathed . It's not a movie that one would ever want to put in someone's hands that one trusts and say "" yes , this is Clint Eastwood's finest couple of hours "" or "" Lee Marvin , such a bad-ass "" ( albeit for the latter it might be so if talking about his facial hair ) . But digging deeper into the careers of either actor , there are slip-ups that looking at them now actually have a good deal of entertainment value to them . It's just that it's executed - if one were to take this seriously - with such a portend of EPIC ( in caps ) quality , of the production values at a level that would be comparable to the 1995 Waterworld at the time that it becomes too much to comprehend on a human level . Yet there's also the sense of buoyancy to it that makes it kind of admirable as it chugs along . Even in the climax , when the entire town is dragged down thanks to the bull that runs through the tunnel , is cheerful up to a point or at least lighthearted . In fact , there's something kind of charming to a movie that takes its subject matter so not seriously . Like , for example , how hundreds of men all drool at the mouths at the sight of Jean Seberg when she arrives into town , and yet the men decide to hold a sort of auction in order to bid her out ( why not gang up on her ? guess the M rating at the time still carried some provisions as part of the puritanical beats of the ol ' West ) . Or how Marvin and Eastwood both become husbands to Seberg when she just can't decide who she loves more ( and , thanks to the most faithful of all , whiskey , the men reach an agreement on the prospect ) . It's all very ridiculous , from the many , many BIG BIG musical numbers - and I say BIG BIG as they are all loudly produced and with a typical movie studio harmony , only without much choreography organized - down to that hat that Marvin wears as he goes about gathering up more prostitutes for the miners . And what about the songs ? Equally insipid , and if taken as real ' quality ' music is to have to smell your socks for an equal effect . But it's also like a good quality brand of cheese : you take a bite and want a little bit more , and the block is still there for the taking . Songs like "" I talk to the trees "" and "" They call the wind Mariah "" , plus anytime Marvin has to sing , is classic stuff on the corniest levels . Oddly enough , Eastwood isn't half-bad as a singer , even with some lift and grace to his voice . Marvin , however , can't sing a note for his life , and the song that apparently won a golden globe or Grammy or whatever has him singing like he's Eeyore the donkey from Winnie the Pooh . When Marvin has to act like a drunken wheez of a prospector who's jealous , greedy , driven by humble melancholy and ego in equal measure , he does alright , and Eastwood , who says more dialog here than in all three of the ' Dollars ' films combined , does what he can . Seberg is also a honey of a starlet , who didn't seem to do much aside from this and Breathless . But as I said , you should go into this knowing what to expect . There was an episode of the Simpsons years ago where Homer looks forward to watching a movie on TV that has Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood , and suddenly he finds that they're singing , a lot . It should be a joke , and it's a hilarious bit of irony really , because it's true . ' What the hell ' will be the first thing to come out of some viewers mouths on finishing the movie , if they get that far . As for me , I just have to smile , crack up laughing a few times , and realize that this is one of the reasons the 70s had to happen .","Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse , along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance .

Boy meets girl at school , they flirt , they date , they run off together . The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced .

All this is accompanied by great cinematography but the music is often intrusive and unwarranted . Not content with marrying a beautiful young woman Samuel and his two other brothers Alfred and Tristan enlist in the Canadian army to fight in the great war where Samuel dies . Alfred and Tristan return to the Montana landscapes where Alfred falls in love with Susannah but it's Tristan who embarks on a sexual relationship with her to the strains of intrusive music , but then Tristan decides to become a hunter on a Pacific island , and after a few years he returns to find Susannah is now married to Alfred who is now a congressman Got the idea ? Got any of the ideas ? There's so many ideas in the above paragraph to keep a Hollywood studio in business for several years .

And I'm sure I missed something . In fact I'm sure I missed everything because I can't recall how all these subplots tie in with each other . What's the reason for the Ludlows being so Anglophile ? Why did Tristan decide to become a hunter ? Oh I forgot to mention that several other of the main characters die which means their relationship to plot becomes superflous in the end .

Due to the lackluster reviews this movie received , I decided to rent it rather than rush out and see it . I find sometimes that films not well received in the theater do better as rentals . I'm not sure why . It may be the shelling out of so much money to see a film nowadays . Nevertheless , I suspect I had a better experience than some people . I won't bother to repeat the story , but I am one person who did not find this film dull , lackluster , or felt like nothing was happening . I found it suspenseful and interesting , with good performances , Ian McKellan being a standout . The scenery was stunning , as was the musical score - the whole look and sound was that of a very big money production , which of course it was . I liked both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou - Hanks never imposes himself on the material , so he didn't try to make more of the Robert Langdon character than is there - which isn't much . Just about anyone could have played the part . Hanks was the icing on an expensive cake . Audrey Tatou was very good in her role . But these parts take a back seat to the intricate and controversial story . "" The Da Vinci Code "" is provocative , exciting , and well done . My only complaint is that it had several of what I call false endings - i . e . , you think the film is over and it isn't . I loved the true ending - once it got there .","Millionaire Chester Farson ( Gordon Gostelow ) dies from heart failure . Eldest son Gerald ( Terance Alexander ) keeps news of his death a secret , hiring Gray to impersonate the old man to avoid paying death duties to the Government . He neglects to tell sister Jane ( Justine Lord ) about the deception , instructing his servants to keep her away from the family home in case she unmasks the fake . Jane spots one of her father's priceless paintings - ' Property Of A Gentleman ' - up for auction in London , and denounces it as stolen property . She brings in McGill to investigate . Breaking into the Farson home , Mac finds Gray , a drunken Shakespearian actor , beginning to live the part . As the plot unravels , Mac is bribed to keep his mouth shut . But will he ? Wilfred Greatorex wrote this , although his name is missing from the credits . Presumably he was unhappy with the way it turned out . It is a decent enough story , based on an entirely believable premise . With Inheritance Tax having recently been made into a hot political issue by the Tories ( inspired by its scrapping in America by the thankfully-gone Bush administration ) , it is interesting to see that even in 1967 the rich considered the paying of ' death duties ' ( as it was then called ) to be grossly unfair . They firmly believe that the tax burden should be placed on those at the lower end of the social scale , and that the law should be toughened for those convicted of minor social security fraud . As ' George Malone ' ( Peter Kerrigan ) observed in Alan Bleasdale's ' The Black Stuff ' : "" Stealing is only thought bad when you take a little from some , instead of a lot from many . "" . The main weaknesses are the casting of Justine Lord and Gordon Gostelow . Lord's role looks as if it was written for Sylvia Syms . She is miscast as an English rose ( though looks stunning in some groovy ' 60's fashions ) . Gostelow , on the other hand , is delightfully eccentric as ' Gray ' ( he was dubbed for his brief role as ' Farson ' ) but there's a bit too much of him . The episode at times takes on a lunatic air reminiscent of ' The Avengers ' . Frank Gatliff as an ' auctioneer ' and Derek Francis ' ' doctor ' provide welcome support .

His dad thinks that cooking and talking to animals isn't a ' real job ' and won't give Kronk the big thumbs up until he's got his own house on a hill with loads of money . From this thin idea comes loads of deception , scheming and hijinks . And that's basically the movie . It IS packed full of hilarious moments and wonderful Looney Tunes-inspired humor like the first , but it just lacks that overall high-quality . Still , it's loads of fun and any fan of The Emperor's New Groove must give it a rent .","Sequels rarely improve on the originals . Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is bursting at the seams with wacky humor , craziness and invention . Yes , the first was a brilliant ride too but it doesn't live up to this . Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just great in their dual roles as good Bill and Ted and evil Bill and Ted robots from the future . I've never really seen Keanu as convincing in anything else , maybe it's the characters he chooses and not his talent . Too bad his biggest exposure has been as a wooden statue in the god-awful Matrix trilogy . But it's not just Reeves and Winter this time , William Sadler's Grim Reaper is also along for the ride and he steals the show like you've never seen before . Rufus isn't in this one for very long but William Sadler more than makes up for that . The plot is a bit much to swallow if you're not familiar with the mechanics of the original . A nasty old tyrant 700 years in the future sends evil robot Bill and Teds back through time in the phone booth time machines to kill the good Bill and Ted and prevent their perfect society taking over the world . Once dead Bill and Ted go to hell , challenge the Grim Reaper to a game of Battleship , visit God ( after a spot of mugging in heaven ) , get help from a Martian , brought back from the dead , make good Bill and Ted robots and take on the evil Tyrant guy during a Battle of the Bands finale . Whew ! Peter Hewitt ( only 25 at the time ) brings a bizarre sophistication to the sequel that wasn't present in the blandly shot first film . B & TBJ literally looks like a whacked-out cartoon come to life . The production design is very colorful and vivid , reminiscent of Tim Burton , only not crap . Don't misjudge this film as being in the same sub-genre as those awful stoners Jay and Silent Bob or even Wayne's World . This is not a dumb generation Xer film , it's a lovely , silly fantasy for all ages and is definitely superior to the original . Hey Warner , hurry up and release the Bill and Ted animated series on DVD . I want it NOW ! Unlike Excellent adventure , this film was shot in plain-old 1 . 85 : 1 and the anamorphic transfer on the DVD looks fine and does justice to the very broad color pallet of film . The soundtrack is in Remastered Dolby 5 . 1 and it sounds above average if not amazing . Definitely get this . Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is thoroughly non-non-non heinous .",102816,102816,True
186,"Four stories written by Robert Bloch about various people who live in a beautiful , old mansion and what happens to them . The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life . Some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good . The second has Peter Cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife . The third has Christopher Lee who has a child ( Chloe Franks ) and is scared of her . It all leads up to a pretty scary ending ( although the ending in the story was MUCH worse ) . The last is an out and out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt ( both chewing the scenery ) and a cape that turns people into vampires ! There's also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula . This is a good horror anthology - - nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills . Also the fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire ! Also the house itself looks beautiful . . . and very creepy . It's well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches . A very good and unusual movie score too . All in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out .

How they get unfrozen shouldn't be too hard to guess but I won't reveal here . There's also some good slapstick pieces involving fire and steam and luggage in the beginning . Wonderful use of color-tinting throughout . Like A Trip to the Moon , The Impossible Voyage is based on a Jules Verne tale and is just as fascinating as the previous film .

187,"Airplane has to be one of the funniest spoofs on the disaster genre ever made . It was a spoof off all those Airport movies with star studded cast members and melodrama beneath the surface . This film has everything except it's just too short in my opinion . I love Julie Hagerty and Robert Hays as the star crossed lovers . Hays as the pilot traumatized by a war so he became a cab driver . Hagerty as his love interest . I love how he describes how he meets and falls in love with her on a tropical island . The rest of the cast is stellar featuring Lloyd Bridges , Ethel Merman , Leslie Nielson , Lee Bryant , Barbara Billingsley , Jill Whelan , Lorna Patterson , Ann Nelson , David Leisure , etc . The scenes are unforgettably funny when Hays confides in Nelson's character . There are typical spoofs of life aboard the flight . Remember Helen Reddy playing a nun singing to an ill girl aboard the flight but this is done with a twist . It's no wonder that the film became a hit to spark a sequel . It could have sparked a sitcom .","It seems that America and Britain and everybody else knew that the Japanese were up to something long before that infamous day in history . Could it have been prevented ? Why didn't they listen ? Who knows now ?

We will never know the truth . Maybe American politicians thought it wouldn't happen but I disagree . They rather it happened then not at all . It was the middle of the great depression and America wasn't involved in World War II . Had America got involved sooner ? How many lives would have been saved ? We will never know the truth . This BBC documentary offers the interviews and depicts the FDR administration as having some knowledge of a possible attack . Why am I not surprised at all ? Maybe it's because the same thing happened on September 11 , 2001 . Of course thousands died needlessly and tragically . Many others suffered the loss of their relatives , friends , colleagues , and neighbors . Unless we learn from attacks on Pearl Harbor and September 11 , 2001 , we will never prevent another attack . It's sad and tragic . Maybe that's why this documentary shows another side beside the loss and that's that it could have prevented in the first place .",33913,33913,True
188,"PUSHOVER is an underrated , little known crime melodrama from the mid-'50s that introduced the blonde beauty of KIM NOVAK to audiences and gave FRED MacMURRAY another chance to play an authority figure seduced by the charms of a femme fatale . When the story begins , it turns out his accidental meeting with Novak was really a set-up , he being a cop assigned to keep track of her whereabouts after a bank hold-up results in the death of a police officer . He suspects that her mobster boyfriend pulled the job and at first resists when she tries to convince him they can use the bank money for themselves . But eventually , he weakens and before you know it he's informing her that her phone is wire tapped and the two of them are just one step ahead of the police for the rest of the film . PHIL CAREY , as a fellow officer and E . G . MARSHALL as the lead detective are excellent in supporting roles , as is DOROTHY MALONE in a pivotal role as a girl occupying the apartment next to Novak in a U-shaped building that enables MacMurray and Carey to keep an eye on both gals through binoculars ( shades of REAR WINDOW ) . Conveniently , no one ever draws the blinds in these sort of thrillers and spying is made so easy for the sake of plotting , as the 24-hour surveillance occupies much of the story . The noir elements are present throughout , the dark rainy streets , the shadowy photography during car chases , the clipped delivery of lines , the murder scheme gone awry , the femme fatale angelic on the outside , bad within . But somehow it never becomes a major film noir , relegated to its place in obscurity over the years and not really a title that pops up when one speaks of film noir - - but it does qualify as noir , on a minor scale , and it's given some taut direction and tight suspense by director Richard Quine . Kim is as easy as ever on the eyes although a bit robotic in her acting technique and never quite convincing as a mobster's moll . MacMurray has a less interesting , more one-dimensional role as a cop corrupted by beauty . All in all , definitely worth watching .","Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell , Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter , and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot . Along with some ancillary Air Force personnel and a comic geek , they are in charge of a super-secret underground laboratory on the West Coast . Morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but nonplussed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the Pacific Ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast . Nobody knows what this colossal , blocky structure is . Obviously it's some kind of carpentered artifact because it's all made up of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on top . It turns out that the machine , dubbed Kronos , is from some far-away planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy . You see , here on earth , we have learned how to convert matter into energy , but on Kronos ' planet they have figured out the other half of the equation - - how to convert energy into matter . And now they're running out of energy on the other planet . Are you taking notes on this ? Good . Maybe you'll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by Kronos ' mission . For instance , if Kronos ' builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa , why don't they just convert a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to extinguish LA's lights ? But it's doubtful the writers could explain it either . Reversing the polarities of two antenna is described as an "" anthropic conversion , "" which means a "" towards-human change "" , which doesn't make sense . But it doesn't seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter . The diagram that Morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction , from positive to negative . There's a problem with Kronos ' locomotion too . It marches along the coast , threatening "" populated areas "" ( read Southern California ) , but it has no joints in its two or three legs . These stumps just thump slowly up and down , squashing some people . The film doesn't make much of these squashed people . They're shown as Mexican peasants , so maybe they don't count for too much . The USAF also drops a hydrogen bomb on Kronos - - while it's in Mexico , mind you . Nobody raises an eyebrow . Not much acting is called for and not much is given . Jeff Morrow has a distinct and resonant voice , great for radio or for TV voice overs . His face is less expressive . He has only one expression , no matter what the situation is - - a tight smile , as if he's having his picture taken at the Universal Studios Tour . Barbara Laurence had a fine , golden quality when she made "" Street With No Name "" a few years earlier . She was a slender seventeen-year-old as Richard Widmark's wife . Here , her grooming and demeanor reduce her to the level of B-movie actress , though she's still beautiful . It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these movies . He's made so many , I get them mixed up . On the whole , the film comes across as flat , I'm afraid . ( There are some nice shots of a B-47 in flight , though . ) The sets reveal a low-budget enterprise . That's not necessarily bad in itself , but there's nothing to make up for the barren settings . Little tension in the script , no directorial display , and little effort put into the performances . You might get a kick out of it - - a relaxed high - - because this is distinctly unchallenging . It's just that there are so many better films of the genre out there .",1048771,819382,False

Incompetent cops Toody and Muldoon spend their free days fishing without much success . They fantasise about going to sea in an expensive boat and catching a swordfish . O'Hara , one of their colleagues at the 53rd Precinct , has just such a boat , or rather his brother-in-law has , so they ask him to let them come along on their next trip . He flatly refuses . To get him to change his mind , they embark on a campaign of ' niceness ' - filling in his police reports , sending him flowers ( causing his wife to suspect him of having an affair ) and sucking up to him in general . Irritated and annoyed , O'Hara relents . But then they cannot get time off work to go on their proposed fishing trip , hence they ask other cops to rearrange their assigned schedules . Soon the duty roster board resembles a snakes and ladders game as the changes are incorporated . When the matter finally appears settled , more trouble looms . Toody and Muldoon nab a quick-tempered motorist , Conroy , for jumping a red light . He admits his guilt , and asks for a ticket so he can go on his way . But if they comply with his request , they will have to go to court the next day and won't be free to go fishing , so they refuse . The driver insists they and no-one else give him a ticket . A fierce row develops . Bystanders look on in bemusement , as more and more cops join the fray . . . This was Nat Hiken's follow-up to the massively successful ' The Phil Silvers Show ' , and is every bit as good , and occasionally better . ' Toody ' is portrayed by ' Bilko ' semi-regular Joe E . Ross , who looks like Ernest Borgnine on a bad day . The character is not far removed from the one he played on that earlier show - ' Private Ritzik ' . As well as exclaiming "" oooh ! oooh ! "" every time he has an idea , he also has a domineering wife ( Beatrice Pons played both ' Emma Ritzik ' and ' Lucille Toody ' ) . Tall , gangling Fred Gwynne , a . k . a . ' Muldoon ' , was in two episodes of ' Bilko ' as ' Private Honergan ' , but is more famous as ' Herman ' from ' The Munsters ' . This script , like the best of ' Bilko ' , begins with a basic premise . Lesser writers might have stretched it to fill the entire half-hour , but Hiken gets it over with quickly and moves on , making all kind of unexpected detours , resulting in comedic chaos . Superb dialogue throughout . Funniest moment - the angry confrontation between Toody , Muldoon and the motorist must rank as one of the funniest scenes in any show and surely must have inspired John Cleese to create the legendary ' Fire Drill ' sequence in ' Fawlty Towers ' !

190,"I'll stick my neck out and state this : Should anyone tell you Hancock is not a good superhero movie , then that somebody probably isn't a superhero comic book fan to begin with . Or perhaps prefers the heroes as morally upright boy scouts with unexplainable fetish for Lycra tights . And for those who reckon that the Hancock trailer had shown its hand , for once I thought that a trailer barely , and I mean barely , scratched the surface of what surprisingly was a thoroughly enjoyable story , which will take its stand proudly amongst this year's line up of comic book / super hero movies . But first , I'd got to admit , I'm a Will Smith fan . So at least you might have this review put into perspective . I've been enjoying the Will Smith Express with the kind of movies he's been doing for his career , even for the badly received Wild Wild West . But this guy has been in almost every genre from action ( thanks to Michael Bay ) to science fiction with I , Robot , romantic comedy with Hitch , a powerful dramatic performance with Pursuit of Happiness , and the recent remake I Am Legend , and each one I find little or no fault with . In fact , save for one or two movies in his filmography which I have not watched , it's no wonder that Smith's A-list material for his legion of fans around the world , having a name that can marquee a blockbuster movie , and one of the more consistently bankable contemporary stars . And Hancock ( ok , for this review I'd lay off all the jokes ) continues in this tradition of entertainment that isn't frivolous . To tell you more about the story would be to ruin whatever surprise it has in store , so I'll not do that . Suffice to say that like all superhero movies , Hancock is also about sacrifice , and I think that's a theme that the genre cannot do away with . It's almost always an exploration about doing the right thing , be it for the love of mankind , or those that touch on the more personal . If you'd believe the trailer as it suggests , then it's suffice to say that Hancock had to grapple with bad public relations from his jerk like behaviour ( stuffing heads up arses being his arsenal of choice ) , and that assistance comes free through the services of Ray Embrey ( Jason Bateman ) , a life which he saved by , well , causing millions of dollars in damages . If I were to scratch the surface just a little bit deeper , then I'd say that Ray represents the kind of normal life that Hancock probably wished to have , the simple , no save-the-world responsibility lifestyle , with a nice little family with wife Mary ( Charlize Theron ) and son Aaron ( Jae Head ) to boot . Director Peter Berg , who last brought us The Kingdom , dabbles with plenty of technology to bring us a man who can fly , possess incredible strength and being invulnerable to bullets . What I'd enjoyed about his take on this superhero movie , is that he didn't find a need to explain everything in verbatim , i . e . what are the powers he possess , where did he come from , and so on . sure they are addressed , but there's no need for putting it in your face , which I suspect lesser directors would have filmed flashbacks , origin subplots , enemies who are megalomaniacs who want to conquer the universe , and so on . They can be mentioned in passing , or a glance , or to let it work it out in your imagination , which of course is a powerful tool . And keeping it simple helped too , as I was really thrilled at how effective , and deceptively simple , its crescendo was developed , that it's tough to fight back tears as it goes for the juggernaut to reach out for your emotions . Clearly there were bits from the trailer which were probably put in as red herrings , or likely to have been reserved for the DVD as deleted scenes . While it runs at just over 90 minutes , the pace is frenetic , though of course not without the usual loopholes , especially with a major sequence probably to show off some cool graphics . If I were to gripe about certain things , it would be how YouTube got a significant product placement , and not actually having the actual , exact clips available ( I may be wrong but I did do a search ) , and having the camera seemed to want to take a jab at Will Smith action movies of old by continuously circling around his face ala Bad Boys . Some may also gripe about not having to see much of the born again Hancock in action , but again , the strength of this movie lies not in how it delivers its set action pieces . So what's my verdict ? To Berg , Smith and the rest of the cast and crew , Good Job ! And don't be a jerk and bolt for the exits the minute the end credits start to roll , or you deserve to have your head stuffed up another's arse .","When looking at this movie , it becomes obvious that it didn't had a very high budget . Not only its settings are kept cheap and simple but also the overall style and atmosphere of the movie . Nevertheless the movie is good enough and also serves its purpose well enough . In my opinion it's always interesting to watch a movie about WW I , since it's a subject that doesn't get much lighted in movies too often . It usually are small European productions like this one that handle the subject . It in my opinion makes WW I an underused part of history in the movie making business . It's a slowly told movie , set purely in British trench during WW I , in France , in the days before the battle of the Somme . One of the bloodiest battles in human history , with over one million casualties . Because the story is slow and set mainly at one location , it allows the movie to deepen its characters out and allow the actors to do their job and carry the movie . It's however definitely true that the movie is filled with far too many characters to put in a 100 minutes short movie . I'm sure the story and all of its characters would had worked out fine in a mini-series but it's a bit too much to put in a movie . It has as a result that none of the characters ever get really interesting - or fleshed out good enough to care about them . It makes the movie emotionally flat and even also quite boring at certain points , also since not really that much interesting is happening in the movie . The dialog and situations are also far too cliché to consider them good or original . The movie offers very little surprises and it makes "" The Trench "" perhaps a bit of an obsolete movie to watch . The actors still do their very best to carry the movie to an higher level . Daniel Craig is really superb in his role and he provides the movie still with some much needed emotions . It was also fun to see Cillian Murphy in a small and early role . Obviously too small to really make a lasting impression though . And than about the end battle . Well , when looking at this movie you should know better than to expect a big spectacular ending . If you already watched the first 90 minutes of this movie , you just know you're plain wrong to expect suddenly something big and spectacular . So in my opinion the ending just felt right and it was suiting with the rest of the movie . But obviously , it doesn't do much justice to the real battle of the Somme that was one of the biggest of WW I and also one of the bloodiest in human history . This obviously really doesn't show on screen however . Good enough to kill some time with . Just don't expect anything spectacular or emotionally powerful .",317399,1416505,False

Alas , she has little to do except give a bit of good advice to Robert DeNiro's psychologist near the beginning and to show up just in time to save his daughter Dakota Fanning's bacon at the end . Robert DeNiro is surprisingly good in what is for him an unusual role , a quiet , thoughtful , analytical humanistic type . With eyeglasses . It isn't until near the end that he become a somewhat more familiar figure . Elizabeth Shue does very nicely by the part of a sensitive and warm woman , of just about the right age too , who wouldn't mind taking the place of DeNiro's recently deceased wife , which she does too , in a curious kind of way . She's quite attractive with her long curly hair the color of straw , schlepping around that magnificent bosom . No wonder Charlie gets jealous . I'm just throwing in these observation seriatim , trying to avoid an outline of the plot , because the plot take the road less traveled and I don't want to give too many hints . Still - - Charlie is the playmate of ten-year-old Dakota Fanning . He may or may not be imaginary . The acts he performs have real enough consequences and they could NOT have been performed by a skinny little ten-year old , so that leaves only two possibilities . Either this movie has a genuine supernatural element , or one of the apparently normal human beings is nuts . Rolling right along with the performances , and passing quickly over a sheriff who has a disconcertingly suspicious habit of smiling at the wrong times ( such as when querying a possible witness to a murder ) , that leaves Dakota Fanning . A ridiculous name , a splendid performance . Where do they find kids who can hold their own against veterans like DeNiro . She shows considerable range and is at least as convincing as anyone else in the cast . And she has this quirky appearance too . In profile , and with her hair styled as it is in this film , she looks amazingly like one of Lewis Carrol's photographs of Alice Liddel . She has the wide face of a child . Her eyes are like two gigantic marbles , white with big blue irises , that seem barely to be held in their sockets by their lids , which slant outward and upwards like a kitten's . If she can make it through adolescence she may have a future in films . The photography is quite good . It captures the gray overcast and denuded thickets of a wintry northeastern forest . The interiors are neatly done as well , except that the lights have an irritating habit of going on and off for no perceptible reason . Each time they go off , there is a loud BANG on the sound track . Ditto , for each time they go on . In the last scene , even a flashlight flicking on and off emits what seems like a sonic boom . Doesn't leave much to discuss except the plot , does it ? And this movie depends a lot on its resolution of the puzzle it's been posing , so I don't want to reveal it . I'll just say it reminded me a bit of the climax of "" The Shining . "" In fact , the whole business could have been written by Stephen King . Come to think of it , there's a similar movie written by King , about a writer in a cabin by a lake who - - Well , enough of that . The plot doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense . Why does the daughter treat Charlie the way she does until the very end ? Some misleading slight of hand there , if you ask me . Worth seeing for the performances , the photography , and the easy shocks . It will not occupy a prominent place in anybody's resume .","I missed the first 20 minutes or so of this film so that may have contributed to my inability to follow some details of the plot . I get the impression , though , that it was pretty complicated to begin with . And there seems to have been some elisions here and there . ( What , exactly , is the significance of the diamond ring ? ) Basically , a gang of thieves takes over a bank and holds hostages . It is to be "" the perfect bank robbery . "" When you hear a phrase like that , used in all seriousness , you must cringe . As it turns out , however , it's not really a robbery at all but rather a scheme to expose the bank's founder and owner for the money-grubbing opportunistic scoundrel he was when he played footsies with the Nazis in order to come into possession of some valuables taken from victims of the genocide . The robbers escape without detection and the lead detective ( Denzel Washington ) alerts the mayor of New York to the nefarious history of the bank's founder ( Christopher Plummer ) . Lee has more smoothly integrated white folks and African-Americans than in some of his earlier movies . And he has turned the police into good guys for a change . To be sure , when all of the hostages are released and come storming out the bank's front door screaming , "" Don't shoot ! Don't shoot ! "" , and the officer-in-charge ( Willem DaFoe ) shouts "" Stand down ! "" into his radio , the assembled cops open fire for a minute or two anyway . Firing into the crowd , they MUST be hitting people and yet no one is hurt or killed . I suppose this is related to an earlier suggestion by DaFoe that they use rubber bullets , even though this is never made clear . But then a lot of the story takes unexpected twists and seems jagged , the way life is , rather than the way movies are . "" He won't execute any of the hostages , "" Washington announces firmly , "" because he's not the type . "" Next scene , we see the principal heavy shoot a hostage in the head . And when offered a promotion as part of a deal to cover up the bank owner's scandalous past , Washington seriously considers it . Everybody else is going to get something out of it and he might as well get his . The performances are uniformly good , as they generally are under Spike Lee's direction . And Lee has an impeccable eye for camera placement and movement . He uses one or two extremely effective overhead shots and is given to angles that turn individuals into masses . Jody Foster , in a relatively small part , gives her most confident performance in years . Clive Owen as the gang leader is a paragon of tranquility throughout . The villain of the piece is Christopher Plummer , head of a bank , filthy rich , and white . And yet even his crimes are mitigated , though not excused . He has insight . "" I sold my soul to the devil , "" he says , "" and I've spent my life trying to buy it back . "" He's turned philanthropist in his later years and has gone about doing good , as John D . Rockefeller did . In "" Do the Right Thing , "" Lee's photographer was Ernest R . Dickerson and he did a splendid job . His DP here seems to have been caught up in current trends and lost sight of his responsibility to the viewer . Most of the movie is shot in darkness with neon-blue highlights . The images are so high in contrast that in the interrogation room they turn almost black and white . The script could have been nothing more than another genre piece , an imitation "" Dog Day Afternoon . "" Instead it's a rather different take on a rather old idea . Worth seeing .",819382,819382,True
196,Good show about a river boat plying it's way from town to town in the old south giving song and dance performances to the entertainment starved locals . Along the way a suave dude who makes his living as a card player meets the show boat owner's daughter and goes off the deep end . Things are great until his old life beckons and he becomes a wanderer again . Well worth seeing with a 2 hanky ending .,"I was honestly expecting total trash when I started watching Get Rich or Die Trying ' , I'm going to be honest with you , I hate rap music . I think it's extremely degrading and insulting to women , all races , and life in general , so I obviously steered away from 50 Cent and his "" music "" . But I figured I might give Get Rich or Die Trying ' a shot , I had nothing else to watch , why not see how much of a disaster this film would be ? This film is supposedly based on 50 Cent's life and how hard it was growing up in his neighborhood , he dealt with a lot . My problems that I had with his life , you choose the life that you want , and him being "" proud to be a gangsta "" is very sad when he could've done so much more . There is so much to question about why Americans are so violent , and this film is making terrible stereotypes , not to mention making more people afraid of African Americans , it's insulting , and I'm a white person ! That's just my thought on the subject and that's why I had a hard time watching this movie , because we need to improve ourselves , big time . But the movie itself seriously isn't as bad as a 3 . 2 rating , I agree that it wasn't a necessary movie , not to mention that it was probably just publicity for 50 Cent , but still , it had a good story , but didn't carry through . The acting was alright , but honestly , I don't know who told rappers they could also act , but I'd really like to meet that person , because most rappers should stick to their day job instead of trying to make everyone feel sorry for them . Choose the right path , and you won't come out to look like such a punk who will be taken seriously .",70535,1293485,False
197,"SPOILERS Until his film career was resurrected by the great innovated as well as bad movie director Ed Wood in 1953 Bela Lugosi's future was going down hill fast in both his work in films and his personal life . With Bela staring in bottom of the basement horror movies and having a very serious addiction to heroin , that almost killed him . It wasn't until that director Wood gave him another chance in his low-budget and later , sadly long after both Bela and Wood's deaths , highly acclaimed horror and pseudo-message films . Films way ahead of their times about transvestites and the danger of Nuclear destruction . Subjects that were very close to Ed Wood's heart and mind . It was these at first obscure but thought-provoking movies that put Bela back on center stage . Working for small film production companies like Monogram Pictures "" The Corspe Vanises "" is one of the many movies that Bela made during the 1940's that were elevated to where they were entertaining and remembered now by just his presents in them . In the movie Bela plays not only the mad scientist / doctor but also the mad herbalist Dr . Lorenz . Dr . Lorenz needs young and beautiful women to use in making his old and crazy wife the Countess Lorenz , Elizabeth Russell , young and beautiful again . Dr . Lorenz developed this orchid that he has secretly delivered to the brides just before their wedding that not only knocks them out but ends up killing them . Lorenz and one of his henchmen Mike , George Eldrdge , wait outside the church with a hearse to pick up the body and take it back to his lab to extract some fluid for the dead brides neck and use it to rejuvenate his mad and elderly wife . The predictable plot has newspaper reporter Pat Hunter , Luana Walters , go to the Lorenz mansion to get the big scoop about the dead and missing brides . Meeting there young and handsome Dr . Foster ( Tristram Coffin ) , who's also there as Dr . Lorenz's guest , they both fall in love and almost end up becoming Dr . Lorenz's next victims . Even though Dr . Foster isn't a young woman or bride he's still subjected to Dr . Lorenz's mad and crazy experiments . Dr . Lorenz's helper at the lab Fagah , Minerua Urecal , ends this whole insanity by doing in both Dr . Lorenz and the Countess at the end of the movie by stabbing them to death . This happens as the mad doctor was about to do in Pat for her fluids to keep the Countess from going stale and nuts . Dr . Foster also comes to Pat's rescue with the police but , as usual , they would have been too late to save Pat if it wasn't for Fagah's actions . Fagah had in in for the crazed Doctor Lorenz after he killed her son Angel , Frank Morgan a prizefighter in real life , who must have taken one two many hard shots to the head during his professional boxing career . Angel was getting a little too involved with the Doctors experiments and the doc didn't like that one bit . Dr . Lorenz was also responsible for the death of Fagah's other son Toby , Angelo Rossitto , a 2 foot 11 inch midget . The diminutive Toby was shot to death by the police and left to die by the fleeing Dr . Lorenz as they attempted to steal another June Bride at a local wedding reception . With Dr . Lorenz out of the picture and no fear of being killed and kidnapped by him and his stooges Pat and Dr . Foster are finally married at the end of the movie .","( There are Spoilers ) Too talky at times with a number of far-out Native American occult-like rituals with the star Billy Jack , Tom Loughlin , involved in some kind of weird snake dance where he's repeatedly bitten by a deadly diamond back rattlesnake and survives only because of his faith in the great Indian Spirit . The movie "" Blly Jack "" really get's down to business when Billy early in the film puts away his pacifism and takes off his boots and socks and socks the bad guys with a few well placed kicks , together with a strong whiff of his foot perspiration odor , sending them running for their lives . Billy a decorated Vietnam War veteran has had it with civilization and lives by himself on a New Mexican Indian Reservation Peace-loving Billy's life is always disturbed by the local ranchers and townspeople who constantly break the agreement between the local Indian tribes and the US government of not trespassing on Indian land . Billy is also secretly in love with Jean Roberts , Delores Taylor , the founder and administrator of the local Freedom School for runaway youths and unwanted adults All this is a thorn in the side of local big shot rancher and political power broker Mr . Stuart Posner , Ben Freed , The trouble starts for Jean's beleaguered Freedom School when Barbara , Julie Webb , the sixteen year-old daughter of deputy Sheriff Mike , Kenneth Tobey , is beaten up and kicked out of the house by her outraged father . This happens when deputy sheriff Mike finds that Barbara spent the summer in a hippie commune in San Francisco and got knocked up by at least a dozen smelly pot smoking longhairs . Taken into the school and after being cleaned up Barbara is then taught the fine points in what life is really all about and most of all after becoming a member of the school's acting troupe Barbara finally finds the family she always wished for but never had . Mike together with Mr . Posner want to get Barbara back in the fold just to show up Jean's ' school and prevent future Barbara's and many of the young men in and around town from joining the Freedom School that has some of the coolest and grooviest looking chicks this side of the Rockies in it . It's Mr . Posner's young and trouble-making son Bernard , David Roya , who really get's thing going downhill with him having the hots for Barbara and at the same time having it in for her peaceful and sensitive young Indian boyfriend Martin , Stan Rice . Martin is so respectful of Barbara that he keeps himself from having any sexual relationship with her , even though Barbara is always trying to get the meek and very shy Martin to go to bed with her , until their wedding night . The jealous and resentful Barnard is always making trouble for the local Indians together with his drinking buddy friends but it's only Billy who's able to keep him and his fellow sht-kickers in line . Bernard goes a bit too far when he attacks and brutally rapes Jean when she sunbathing nude by the lake and even worse , if he could be any worse that he already is , tracks down a crippled Martin . Bernard shoots the life-long pacifist dead with four bullets in his skull leaving his bullet-ridden floating in the river . Billy Jack finding out about Barnard despicable actions goes on a rampage and finds the lowlife creep in a cheap motel-room getting it on with an underage 13 year-old girl ! Taking a bullet from this now exposed child-molester Billy whacks the sicko right across the throat killing him . I for one was hoping that Bernard would finds himself , like Barbara did , by joining the Freedom School and learning what it's like to be a kind decent and loving human being . I had a bit of sympathy for Bernard earlier in the movie when he couldn't bring himself to shoot a number of wild horses at the insistence of his ultra-macho and domineering father Mr . Posner . It's sad that Bernard became the most hated person in the film later on where anything bad that happened to him wasn't quite good enough . Billy Jack not through with his work to clean up the town , after dispatching that lowlife pedophile Bearnard , later has it out with deputy Mike putting a bullet between his eyes . Mike's daughter Barbara , who was with Billy at the time , not as much as blinked her eyes in shock which showed how much , or how little , she thought of her dad . Surrounded by the towns police force and the entire New Mexican National Guard Billy plans to go out blazing with both ends burning but is talked out of it by a sobbing Jean . Jean tells the confused and wounded , from being shot in the ribs by Bernard , Indian half-breed that him being alive will do a lot more for her and the children of the Freedom School then ending up dead . Jean then tearfully admits to Billy that she was also in love with him . With Billy getting an air-tight guarantee in writing that the Freedom School , with Jean running it , won't be closed down by the US Government all that's left in the movie is for the unforgettably emotional ending : Billy Jack being taken into custody with the entire town giving him he heads , or fists , up to the music of the films heart-lifting theme song "" One Tin Soldier "" .",2721657,2721657,True
198,"Apparently a variation on LA CHUTE DE CINQUIEME ETAGE , this one is about a drunk who throws his wife and family out of the window - - at least apparently since the first half is not known to survive . Then , in sorrow , he tries to hang himself . Although Melies is primary remembered for his flights of fantasy and feats of magic , he turned out a fair number of serious pieces , including a series of shorts about the Dreyfus Affair in 1899 ; and some of his fantasies had serious undertones to them . It's interesting to see this straight-out piece of melodrama . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .","This film had the potential to be a chilling horror story , but never really exploits its strong ( if highly unoriginal ) premise ( seemingly innocent kids are actually the bloodthirsty villains ) . The slow-moving , drawn-out script is one of the major drawbacks ; the two main characters fail to win our sympathy because they are portrayed as two dumbos who take forever to realize what's going on . Their behavior becomes really idiotic sometimes , reaching a zenith of stupidity when the hero throws away his machine-gun , the only weapon that could possibly protect him at the time . The movie is often amateurishly directed ( on a low budget ) and it never provides an explanation for the kids ' murderous rage . And I know that even Hitchcock couldn't find an appropriate explanation for the attacks of the birds in his 1963 classic , but we rarely question the motives of birds . We are dealing with kids here , however , and the whole thing , though not unwatchable , just seems overlong and arbitrary .",1617546,386241,False
199,"Some movies become forgotten over the years , and "" We're No Angels "" is one of them . It's not a great comedy , but it's not a bad one , either . It's far more serious and moralistic than I had ever imagined , and Robert De Niro and Sean Penn essentially run around posing funny faces for the camera throughout , whilst the Catholic religion is used as a structural backdrop . It's a very different sort of role for De Niro , whose comedy is usually a bit more sophisticated . Here he barely talks at all , and when he does , it's usually harsh barking or screaming or frustrated whispers . It's not De Niro's most memorable role but it's certainly an unusual one . A lot of the movie focuses on mishaps and misconceptions , as all of the movies from this genre do . It bears resemblance to last year's "" School of Rock , "" about a loser who was mistaken for a teacher . This time the loser is equal to a pair of two escaped convicts and the teacher position is likewise that of priests . The story all begins with Ned ( De Niro ) and Jimmy ( Penn ) escaping from a northern jail circa 1930 . After heading for the Canadian border , they find themselves pursued by a ruthless jail warden and a town of do-gooders . Luckily for the duo , right before they come to the Canadian border , they are mistaken for two long-lost Catholic priests , Fathers Brown ( Penn ) and O'Reilly ( De Niro ) . After given an introduction to the area by a fellow priest ( Hoyt Axton ) , they decide to hide out for a while using their new personas . No one would ever suspect a priest , right ? The problem is that Fathers Brown and O'Reilly are supposed to be two of the smartest priests alive , having written a controversial book about the true meaning of the chapter Revelations in the Bible . So you can imagine the fear that Jimmy experiences when he is asked to lead the church in a pray prior to a meal . Meanwhile , the mandatory romance is inserted into the movie , using Demi Moore's single , rough , over-protective mother as the love angle for De Niro's character . Demi spits out an unconvincing northern accent , as De Niro stares at her a lot with critical eyes and tries to get her into bed . The romance is not necessary but it seems a lot more worthwhile than most of the romances in some of these films . The movie is one of the most forgotten I have ever seen ; I'd never really heard of it prior to purchasing the newly-issued DVD . But I figured De Niro and Penn couldn't be that bad , and I was right . I think part of the reason so many people like to ignore it is that it doesn't poke fun at religion . It doesn't make the clergymen out to be strange idiots . Rather , it makes the two escaped convicts seem out-of-place in a heartwarming place . The spirituality affects Penn's character , Jimmy , and his final decision on the bridge that separates Canada from America is one that we have sensed was long coming since his fascination in the church grew . De Niro and Penn have two of the best faces in Hollywood , and a movie like "" We're No Angels "" uses this to its advantage . Making up for the long gaps of laughter , the director , Neil Jordan , focuses more on his two lead actors and their reactions to situations . Most of the time throughout the film , De Niro shrugs his shoulders a lot and emits low , agreeable groans from his throat in response to questions , while Penn looks confused and bewildered . There's a great scene where an eager-to-please clergyman ( John C . Reilly ) asks "" Father Brown "" something about his book , and Penn sort of stares at him for a few moments with searching eyes , trying to find a way out of the situation . For some reason , the mistaken identities setup has been a long-time fascination for Hollywood . Just look at "" Some Like it Hot , "" "" Tootsie , "" "" Nuns on the Run , "" "" Sister Act , "" "" School of Rock , "" etc . I think it's because we can all relate to a lot of the situations that the characters go through , and a lot of the embarrassment they suffer . We like to watch them ease their way out of dangerous areas and lie through their teeth . "" We're No Angels "" is one of the better examples of this formula executed quite well . It's not a terrific movie , but the actors are , and the script by David Mamet comes up with its own occasionally hilarious segments that make the movie uneven , but a lot more fun than you might expect . No , it's not great , but it's just funny - - and sweet - - enough to recommend . stars . - John Ulmer","Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man  is total crap at its best ( or worst ) . This movie is garbage ? excessive and stupid . It's also extremely homoerotic , packed to the gills with fetishistic male machismo , sweaty muscular men , and Don Johnson constantly wearing an open shirt . ( By the way , he's nicknamed Cowboy . Hmm . ) In the opening sequence , Harley Davidson ( Mickey Rourke ) is cruising along on his bike . He stops for gas , and when he enters the station , there's a hold-up going on . He strides up to the front and asks for ten bucks ' worth of gas . The robber shouts something at Rourke to the effect of , "" You idiot , I'll kill you ! "" Rourke keeps his cool , whips the gun out of the dude's hand and smashes his face in . The other robber , a knife-wielding weirdo straight out of a Joel Schumacher movie , screams : "" I'm gonna cut you long , hard and deep ! "" Now , is this what one heterosexual male would say to another man ? No way . Need I mention he takes a swipe at Rourke like a pansy ? The movie is one of those absurd , bright , eccentric late ' 80s / early ' 90s hybrids , where the neon glow of the past decade carried on into the hard , visceral dimension of 1990s cinema ? resulting in , for lack of a better word , schlock . During the aforementioned holdup , the camera pans down to the hostages of the store ? two black guys , both looking very stereotypical , and one looking a bit like Steve Urkel ( complete with the glasses ) . It's just awful , awful stuff ; and the vibrant colors of the clothing , backgrounds and foregrounds are dizzying and nausea-inducing . The dialogue is atrocious . Example : Harley : Where are you headed ? Beautiful Hitchhiker : Nowhere in particular . Harley : Well , let me take you there . It's spoken so poorly , it becomes the punch line of an unintentional joke . Avoid this movie at all costs ; unless you enjoy movies that are so bad they're good . In that regard , "" Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man "" is a classic . Graded as a regular movie , it's complete garbage . P . S . I'm a huge fan of Mickey Rourke so I secretly think this movie rules to a degree of coolness because he's such a bad @ $$ in it . But it's still stupid and insulting .",1173088,1173088,True
