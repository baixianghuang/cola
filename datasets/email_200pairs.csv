Subject: Re: looking for ""Fat Tails"" in time-series for NGI-SOCAL  

Tanya, Naveen,

Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes 
of prices and positions.
This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas 
portfolio. A big jump in
the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price 
movement may produce an
observation that looks artificially big.

If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there 
should be 
no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach
is to separate the price process from the position changes.

Naveen,
I am trying to answer the question: what is the appropriate stochastic 
process to model the behavior
of commodities' prices in our VAR model. So what  I do care about is the 
behavior of log-returns. 
Any help is appreciated.

Tanya.

Tanya,
               We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move","Data: Cannot perform this operation on a closed database

Hi Tracy!

How are things going?  I'm slowly getting back in the groove!

I am currently working with the Annual Report writer on the ETS portion of the book.  Do you know who drafts the copy for the Enron statistical report?   Also, may I get a copy of the 1999 statistical report from you?

Thanks for your help.

4,"the participants had owned and/or contract rights from MIDC to their

then creating separate transaction source at the same place.

I did feel that this issue shouldn't be brought to IS's attention - that we
would just work it out with our business practices.  What do you think?

Mirant Shares Continue to Tumble


    Shares of Mirant fell for a 7th consecutive day yesterday, hitting a
record low amid speculation of loss of trading business after its credit
rating was cut to junk status last month. The stock dropped $0.77, down
5.9% to $12.21 per share after earlier dipping to $11.80. It has tumbled
24% since January 4th. Mirant CEO claims the company is still doing strong
business and intends to meet with Moody's this week to discuss the
downgrade. Moody's downgraded Mirant to 'Ba1' its highest junk rating,
from lowest investment grade 'Baa2'. Moody's also says the rating outlook
remained negative. A day after the rating cut, Mirant sold stock, raising
$759 million, and said it will shed assets and cut capital spending by
40%.

8,"pipe and storage infrastructures are thought to be ""adequate"" for 
this year, the PG&E utility is expecting continued high load factors and 
prices over the summer and winter periods. 
Of concern to both utilities is the current interest among elected officials 
and regulators to increase reserve margins to the double-digit levels. Their 
question is who is going to pay for maintaining the excess capacity; the same 
question applies to the electric side, too. 
In implementing current plans to add 375 MMcf/d of pipeline capacity, 
SoCalGas would increase its overall capacity to about 3.9 Bcf/d. ""Our 
indications are that is going to be more than adequate and will add 
substantial excess capacity,"" SoCal's Lorenz said (see Daily GPI, May 29 
<http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010529e.html>). 
The existing expansions now before the CPUC but not part of the global 
settlement struck last year would be re-evaluated in light of the settlement 
should it be adopted in the next two or three months, Lorenz said.<\s>Are you going?

Subject: Bistineau
Importance: High


Don,
 
This is a long e-mail and I apologize for that but since we have not had a chance to talk, I wanted to send you some information on Bistineau as well as the latest output from the Storage Group's M & A analysis.
 
The M&A analysis was just updated as they have been several reservoir transactions in the past few months (AEC @ Manchester, Atmos @ East Diamond, and Aquila @ Lodi).  Prior to these transactions we did not have enough data points to draw meaningful conclusions about the trends in reservoir acquisition.
 
I have attached the output for your review but I think a couple of points are key.
 

The reservoir curve is ""hockey-sticking"" just as the salt curve did previously.  While not as dramatic as salt, the premiums are increasing dramatically. 
The market is NOT placing a premium on optionality.  Salt is inherently more flexible than a reservoir, yet on a deliverability basis, there does not appear to be a significant difference.  That may explain why we see players who DO value optionality in the marketplace (Aquila, AEC, Duke, etc).  These companies have long established asset based storage groups and actively trade around these assets.

As far as Bistineau is concerned, there are several points worth highlighting.  I have attached output from the database maintained by the Storage Group for your reference. I have not included caverns but we do have that data.

Reliant Energy is part owner of the facility.  Reliant is aggressively trying to build a merchant storage business.  My group has bumped into them several times in the marketplace. 
Since the facility is federally regulated, Reliant and Koch would be required to make a NGA 7(b) filing to abandon the services they provide their customers before anyone could purchase the reservoir.  The length of this process would be a function of the number of intervenors.  
Bistineau is a very large reservoir with a large amount of native base gas.  How much of this volume is recoverable (and therefore monetizable) is a large question mark. 
Relative to its peers, Bistineau is a poor performer in terms of flexibility (low injection capabilities) 
Koch has, in the past, written off losses at B",mail_2501,mail_262,False

I am also sure by now you have heard the news about Cuba --- I am so sad about his passing - my understanding was that the chemo was working on his cancer (which had recurred from last year) but when he was supposed to be discharged, he came! down with pneumonia and died shortly after.

AWESOME VISIT
On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed!
The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!

travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling 
me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our 
security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him 
to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people 
over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but 
I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If 
you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate 
with that person.

through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of 
whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work 
day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he 
would come.

At Mike's earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill & Associates to help on 
security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I 
asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done 
a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been 
overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates, removing (in a lowkey 
yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them 
through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from 
the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a 
complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from 
servers, desktops and laptops. In addition, she has coordinated security for 
all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony 
Duenner of EBS Asia.

Again, we appreciate all the help.

Subject: Draft Decision on SDG&E Voluntary Rate Stabilization Program for 
Large Customers

Commission Wood issued a Draft Decision on the rate stabilization program
for SDG&E's large customers required by AB 265.  If you remember, SDG&E
filed its proposal to implement the program  in mid-September.  ARM filed
reply comments supporting the proposal advanced by SDG&E.  The Draft
Decision adopts SDG&E's proposal with a few minor changes.  Having reviewed
the draft decision, in my opinion, the few changes  made do not impact ARM's
interests and thus do not merit commenting.  

The changes made by the Draft Decision include: 

1. The Draft Decision provides for a 12 month amortization period of the
undercollected amount for agricultural customers whose demand is less than
100 kW.  (This would just be a limited exception to SDG&E's overall proposal
that customers under the program would have to pay the entire settlement
amount the month following either removal from the program or being on the
program for 12 consecutive months.

2.  The Draft Decision provides for alternate means of showing
creditworthiness to be eligible for the program",mail_2468,mail_627,False

Subject:	California Contract Language 

Some thoughts --

1.	Why use the ""Special"" term?  Just call it DA Charges.  What makes these charges special.  Parallels the def we use of ""Special Utility Charges.""  Also connotes that these are often imposed outside the normal course of business.
2.	Why limit to ""energy procurement"" or ""public purpose""?  For instance, if the Utilities were to implement a line item charge for past Negative CTC payments, I don't think your language would cover this. Isn't that ""future payback of past under collections""?  Seems to me to relate to energy procurement--ie their avoided cost of energy procurement
3.	Does this include the potential for ""positive CTC""?  We don't want to miss this cost.  Customer pays CTC as part of ""T&D Charges.""  CTC is expressly included in the definition of those charges.
4.	What do we do with post March 31, 2002 rate periods?  While the AB1890 rate freeze is premised to continue until March 31, 2002 or when generation-related stranded costs are recovered, we don't know what will be happening after then.  Want to make sure that any non-bypassable charge is paid by customers, including T&D, along with our generation rates.  All T&D is passed through to customer, regardless of","mid-2001, the commissioner added.

     Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support 
having generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The 
commission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's 
troubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence 
that would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to 
documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.

     Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate 
the market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said 
rates were ""unjust and unreasonable.""

     The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also 
concluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in 
order to drive up wholesale power prices.

     The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to 
pass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers.

     The commissioner said ""if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the 
utilities would be left holding the bag.""

     PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale 
power. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a 
state-mandated rate freeze.

     As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive 
Officer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover 
more than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay 
off employees and reduce major capital spending.

     PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow 
the utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers.

Paul,
I think James Centilli is running his model against a 15% rate of return on equity.  I don't know if the FERC would otherwise provide for a 15% return unless a case could be made for the higher rate to compensate the partners for the credit risk/cost of non-investment grade financing.

I think this is a call maybe for Rod Hayslett to make with respect to FERC regulated ROE.  If we think 15% is insufficient, then what is the appropriate level?

Jeff

Jeff,

In reference to the project, the comment I would offer is in regard to the currrent S&P rating of Pemex. Presently they are rated from USD perspective of BB+ and in Pesos, BBB+. Due to their USD rating of one level below investment grade, the question was raised by Jerry if the rate of return would increase. Also, it is my understanding that the contracting entity is MGI Supply and Pemex would provide a guaranty.

Wendy<\s>In anticipation of your meeting tomorrow, I have attached a summary of 
Enron's credit exposure to PG&E Corp and its affiliates as of Friday, January 
5th.  I will be happy to provide you updated numbers if necessary in the AM.

Please call if you have any questions.

This draft is very preliminary.  We have not received any input from the Market Risk group or Regulatory.  I have passed for comments to David Port and Jim Steffes.  My initial view on Risk Adjusted Capital for Market Risk is that it will be zero based on the offsetting position currently in the book.  We will have more information in the morning.

We can discuss further tomorrow.

Louise,

Per the request of Bill Bradford, attached please find an initial draft of the DASH for the DWR put option.  Please note that we are waiting on a final, legal risk memorandum as well as comments from Jim Steffes for the regulatory risks.

Please let us know if you have any questions or initial comments.

Regards,
Tracy<\s>More broadly speaking, we need to insure that the assignment of capacity 
leaves the pipeline no recourse back to Enron for everything outside of the 
contract year.  If this is not the case, we should revisit the credit 
reserve.   If this is the case then we need to rebook the transactions to 
reflect this.

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.<\s>Tana,

Attached are the credit worksheets for Royal Bank of Canada and Bow River 
Trust.  As we discussed we have proposed letters of credit for the approved 
form of collateral pending further discussion with Treasury regarding funding 
impact.  We may have to move to cash margining if necessary.

		 Subject: Governor Davis letter<\s>Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:

Urged us to ""stay at the table"".

Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from 
which to calculate offering prices).

QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight.
says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply).
believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased 
forward (perhaps by state entity).

Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost 
based at  4?/kwh.

If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new 
commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% 
of SCE supply).

Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this 
evening.

Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as 
high as 6.0?).

Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government 
facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.

Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.

Says securitization may be harder to get.

Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear 
payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities 
over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the 
progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.

Let's discuss at 10:30 call tomorrow.<\s>----- Forwarded by Maureen McVicker/NA/","by Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron on 08/21/2000

Argyle's 2000 vintage Pinot Noir is available now and it's time to stock up on this excellent value before

Flavors lean toward black fruits; black cherries and blackberries with a small earthy and seasoned cedar component.. Medium-bodied, this wine is unctuous with big fruit and a firm tannin finish sanded by sweetness from the fruit flavors..

Better Information and Rationalization of Resources
It time to consider having one EWS fundamentals site. 
It is both silly and a waste of resources to have  multiple models for various commodities.
Information and efforts need to be shared across the company.
Having multiples sites also limits information flow to trading. Traders should not have to search across multiple sites to receive information.
Why are 3 different analysts doing the same job in three different groups. (Example: Power, Gas, Crude--all do their own API analysis- why have 3? keep the best one and make it stronger.

Publications and IT are Expensive
This year we have eliminated duplication within EGM with regard to publications. It is now time to move cost consolidation across EWS.
Some publications cost in excess of  $100K per year. All duplication needs to be eliminated.
It is very expensive to keep 3 IT teams developing 3 different fundy sites. In EGM alone, this year we have  spent $1.5MM on IT.
We need to stop the island mentality. Leveraging off one platform could easily save millions.

I look forward to discussing these issues and receiving your feedback.

evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind

Thanks for sending the letter along.  I forwarded it to Mitch Taylor for his 
information and review.  I'm comfortable sending the letter (assuming Mitch 
agrees).  I want to call Steve Oldham first and warn him of the problem.  

I am uncomfortable taking any further formal action at least until we have a 
meeting with Sierra on the PGE transaction that was scheduled for this week 
and may take place next week.    Do we have any idea on what further delay is 
costing us (i.e., $__/month)?

              200-year lease in September.  The National Electricity

          ?  China:  China is aiming for nationwide interconnection,
              including Hong Kong, by 2010. Power pooling and increased
              interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai
              provinces.  As there is no process or body in place to
              oversee reforms, some believe that sector reform is a mere
              slogan. Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs
              following a government decision to cap the ROR for new
              projects at 10%.  Another issue is lack of government
              guarantees.  China plans to build hundreds of small rural

              which will open the distribution market and reduce node
              (unregulated) prices from 2MW to 0.2 MW.  Until now,
              transmission charges have been based on existing operating
              costs. Under the proposed reform, they would be calculated on
              the operational costs of an optimum network. The reforms also
              intended to remove control of the grid operation from the
              generators.  The proposed changes likely account for Hydro
              Quebec's being the sole bidder among those pre-qualified for
              the 100% sale of Transelec in September.
              1999 marked a serious recession and drought, seriously
              affecting hydro generators, which represent nearly 80% of
              Chile's generation.  Under the existing system, generators
              had no incentive to plan for long-term supply.  Chile hopes
              the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to
              generation and to introduce competition into distribution,
              heretofore a monopoly.

		 Subject: Doorstep meeting

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised!However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

Subject: Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission



Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. 

Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call.

Hi Steve, 

For some awful reason, this did not make it to you on Friday afternoon when I

I received your agenda changes, but I would appreciate you looking over the 
steering committee when you have a chance.

May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along 
with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly 
volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you 
that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  
The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.

asking about it.  He even said ""You are so sweet with words"".

      under the January law that put the state in the power buying
      business, the state
      must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3 billion is
      needed to
      service the debt.
      PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to
      announce his
      ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC
      vote on the
      matter as early as next week.
      * The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers,
      known as
      qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an
      average of
      more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday,
      Davis said
      he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year
      contracts and 7.5
      cents for five-year contracts.
      Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said
      Tuesday that the
      commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern
      California
      Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in
      the future.
      Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have
      enough cash on
      hand for that.
      ""We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,""
      Lynch said.
      ""The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't been
      paid and that
      it is impairing their ability to provide power.""
      The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they

Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.

Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

It's late, but here are a few initial thoughts:

1.  If they can't get the work done with five lawyers, adding a Christian Yoder or Steve Hall to the mix won't save the day.  (Okay, maybe it would, but I won't tell them that.)  

2.  Our traders need both of us to get the work done and to continue our great run of profitability.  Why change something that is working so well?  

3.  I joined Enron to work with Christian and to report to Elizabeth.

My position on work allocation is as follows:

If the proposed project was something I would have done for Paul, Stewart, or John before they joined Orig, e.g., WAPA/BPA deal; EEI Master Contract; or a structured commodity deal, I would be happy to help in any way that I can add value.  But if the project is an asset-driven transaction---e.g., something like Longview or LV Cogen, then I think that the Orig lawyers need to take that work.

Subject: Bio - new member

Hi Everyone, 

This is the'short bio' that was requested. It is
reprinted here. 
My name is
Vanessa and I am in the process of adopting from
Kazakhstan. I live in Connecticut. I have completed
the home study process but am waiting for one more
piece of paperwork to come back, that will make it
official. I've also started the INS process. My
homestudy agency is the Adoption Resource Center of
Connecticut and I plan to work with World Child on the
actual adoption. I have already been in touch with
them.
I am hoping to adopt two children as an older single
parent (no more than 1 boy). I would like the children
to be between 1 and 5 or 6 years old, and, if
possible, siblings.
I would like any information that I can get on the
process for the next stage of it, any information from
people who have 'been there' and I would love to
network with people who will be doing this as well.
Many thanks and I look forward to'meeting' all of
you.

Vanessa

The hardest part about this decision, and the one I think some people 
don't think enough about, is what the child's situation is likely to 
be 2 or 3 years down the road.  

Nicholas was at about the 25th percentile for height (given his bio 
age) when we brought him home -- but is now -- less than 18 months 
after coming home -- at about the 60th percentile for height.  When","the original transaction be pursued even though certain rulings by state regulators in Kansas appear to make this nearly
impossible.  PNM and Western had agreed previously that WR had to complete its corporate separation plan, separating its
utility operations from its nonutility businesses, before the merger could be completed.  However, the regulators in
Kansas refused to approve the terms of WR's corporate separation plan and they have ordered a halt to the implementation
of the separation plan.  Kansas regulators want changes to be made to the corporate separation plan in order to provide
a stronger balance sheet for the utility post separation.
*	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the acquisition of PowerGen of the U.K. by German
utility E.On last week.  Also last week, regulators in the state of Virginia approved the acquisition.  Previously, the
state of Kentucky also approved the deal.  The approvals from FERC, Virginia and Kentucky were needed because PowerGen
owns LG&E Energy, the U.S. electric utility that serves most of Kentucky and a portion of Virginia.  The SEC still needs
to approve the merger, which is expected to be completed in the spring of 2002.  We expect E.On to use this deal as a
springboard toward making several other acquisitions of U.S. utilities.  Right next door to LG&E Energy is one of our
top takeover candidates, Cinergy Corp. (CIN-$31.90, rated Strong Buy).
*	Utility stocks lagged the overall market last week.  For the five trading days last week, electric utility
stocks went down in value by 3.9% compared with a gain of 1.9% for the S&P 500.  IPP stocks had a strong week, with an
average stock appreciation of 8.2%

fee per ticket.  

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.    

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $220","to:lhinson@allianceworldwide.com>

 <<>><\s>While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing

      landmark order that forced utility companies to open their
      transmission lines to
      other utilities and electricity wholesalers. The commission and many
      private
      economists expected that by prying open protected markets,
      electricity prices
      would immediately fall.
      That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in
      California,
      New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states. Generating
      companies rushed
      to expand in the new, borderless market.
      But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as
      electricity
      deregulation has spread nationwide. Congress has forced it to trim
      its staff in
      recent years. Officials complain that investigating abuses in
      electricity
      markets strains their resources.
      And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have
      begun sparring
      publicly among themselves about what to do. This week, Mr. Massey, a
      Democratic
      commissioner, and Mr. Hebert (pronounced AY-bear), a Republican, sat
      side by
      side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions.
      Mr. Hebert
      said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to
      get supply
      there.'' Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging
      ''unlawful''
      and said that his agency, by not reining them in, ''is simply not
      doing its
      job.''
      The agency's leadership has been in flux for months. Congressional
      and industry
      officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing

For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from usage.  Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by others to the citygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport this gas in ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is responsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated.

Good morning, 

Hope you had a great Easter weekend. 

Attached are two (2) word files for your review.  First, there is the latest  
draft of the Sales Proposal which reflects the best efforts and intra day  
provisions.  Second, there is the Alternate Nominations provisions.  I spoke  
with PPL this morning and said that I would try to get both of these  
documents to them today.  Your timely review and comments are greatly  
appreciated. 

The Alternate Nominations language is being separately provided at the  
request of PPL so that they can review it.  If they would like to have it  
incorporated, it can easily incorporated into the proposal and/or agreement. 

Chris, I used the working draft of the Enron/Citizens agreement from our  
meeting last Monday in Houston to draft the Alternate Nomin",mail_3826,mail_3826,True

Enron's Dabhol Project Nears Auction Block


    Lenders to Enron's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power in India are set to put
it on the auction block, with 6 major companies likely to express
interest. The plant has been idle since last June after a dispute over the
cost of the power for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity
Board. Due diligence is expected to begin early next month, with a
possible deadline of the middle of March for submitting offers. Interested
foreign companies are Shell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France. Potential
Indian buyers are BSES Ltd, Tata Power and Gas Authority of India.
Publicity which focused on Enron's problems in India has given the
country's image a black eye as a safe place to invest. Some in India claim
that Enron coerced and hoodwinked a freshly elected state government into
signing off on a power project it had previously tried to stop. The World
Bank, which refused to fund the project, said it was too large, too costly
and the terms were slanted in Enron's favor. Maharashtra's demand for
energy did not rise as expected and meanwhile, the devaluation of the
Indian rupee and climbing prices for naphtha raised the price of power
production. Enron owns 65% of the Dabhol project, GE and Bechtel each own
10% and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 15%. Those interested in
acquiring the plant must put up a non-refundable $100,000 in earnest
money. The sellers intend to sell the plant as a whole, but bidders may
bid jointly for the operation and split it up later. A London data room
will be established for the commercial and financial agreements, operating
and historical data, projections and information on the status of Phase
II. Construction on the 1,444 MW second phase was stopped when the state
electricity board fell $240 million behind in payments. The 740 MW first
phase was launched in 1999.

r sell.   In addition to the information regarding the company you are moni=
t","you were from some work I did back in September as I was looking 
for volume numbers.  The notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers.

 Briefly, the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and 
noncredit risk.   Ideally, this would be anything that effects NPV of the 
deal.  However, I think that we should limit ourselves to those things that 
effect the time and amount of the EAM volumes.  Even here, such a problem set 
is quite large.  If you glance at the spreadsheet model, you will notice that 
there exists a large number of possible items that effect the EAM volumes.  
If we are to do this rigorously, then it is necessary to tear apart EES's 
business model, and although such an attempt to do so would be noble, the 
scope of such an excercise may be too large.  We need a clear definition of 
EES Operational Risk.

 Briefly, from the EES deals that I have looked at, two things drive their 
profit:  a long term bet that power prices will go down, and that we can 
improve the facility through various enhancements.  Each of these may be 
gleaned from the spreadsheet, as well as the assumptions regarding the 
funding of the facility improvements and so on.  95% of the savings is 
assumed to come from power, and 5% from gas.  (The effeciency gain may not be 
explicitly given).  If we have data that show the realized efficiency gains, 
then it would be simple [in principle] to determine a distribution, and hence 
a distribution of EAM volumes, NPV's, etc.  At this time, I understand that 
RAC has determined some of the realized efficiency gains, but my knowledge is 
quite sketchy.  Jay Hachen may have more info.

 If I get a chance, I will try to see if I can do a ""proof of concept"" 
excercise, but I have a late January deadline on something else.

 Another point:  even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet 
model, EES has chosen to book things differently.  I do not have a thorough 
understanding of their IT systems, but at least in principle, if we can do",mail_13398,mail_9155,False

Natural Gas Futures Continue Higher on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX continued higher
yesterday on more short-covering, gaining $0.041 to $2.291 per MMBtu. The
March contract rose $0.033 to $2.273 per MMBtu. The market opened higher
and traded range-bound bouncing off $2.32 several times as it awaits the
AGA storage report due out this afternoon. Look for a withdrawal about 150
- 160 Bcf reported for last week. Some say that since physical prices
maintained a premium to the NYMEX could be companies buying on the spot
market to keep from pulling stored natural gas that was pumped into the
ground at higher prices. If that is the case, a lower withdrawal and
subsequent price tumble could be in the offing. Physical prices gained
slightly yesterday on nominal cold in the West. Natural gas for next day
delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.03 - $0.07 higher
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.04
to $2.36 per MMBtu.

Guys,

I received a call from Mike Garred, admin for The New Power Company, wanting 
to confirm that his company is properly set up in EOL ---- everything is fine 
from our end.  What does this customer need to do to get credit?

Thanks,
Griff<\s>We have not done any recent analysis since the end of January or maybe even 
the end of December.  I will have Rod Nelson and Tanya Rohauer relook at the 
impact of the changing yield curve on Credit Reserve.

We have a lot of improvements we need to make on our current methodology when 
we have the time and resources to dedicate to it.

Subject: Credit reserve update

Bill,

Most recent Vincent's update on what's going on with the credit  model.

Another issue. I am increasingly concerned with our general approach to the 
generation
of probabilities of default. Recent developments in the credit markets are 
likely to
change completely the dynamics and levels of  interest rate spreads. I am 
curious if
you looked at the credit reserve based on the current yield curves (as of the 
last few days).

Vince

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

new IPP plants.  Allegheny (as reported recently) is looking at building a=

Palo Verde area. =20


Allegheny buys Enron plants
Allegheny Energy Supply, the unregulated
generation unit of Maryland-based Allegheny
Energy, showed further proof this week of its
aspirations to become a nationwide wholesale
power provider, buying gas-fired plants from
Enron that serve three regions.
Financial terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed, but Allegheny will take possession of
three peaking units developed by Enron North
America: the 546-MW Gleason plant in Gleason,
Tenn.; the 508-MW Wheatland plant in
Wheatland, Ind.; and the 656-MW Lincoln Energy
Center in Manhattan, Ill.
Allegheny has been building and buying
facilities in Pennsylvania but last month gave the
first signal of its broader aspirations, announcing
plans to build a 1,080-MW unit in Arizona.
The three plants being acquired from Enron
all were developed after the 1998 price spikes
in Midwest markets, which highlighted the lack
of flexible generation in the area. All three entered
commercial operation in June 2000.
Don Feenstra, vice president of new
projects at Allegheny Energy Supply, said the
acquisitions fit with the company=01,s broader goal
of doubling the original size of its generation fleet
(about 8,200 MW) in five years. The three Enron
plants total 1,710 MW, swelling Allegheny=01,s portfolio
to more than 12,000 MW. Once the first goal
is reached, Allegheny wants to increase its generation
holdings by another 50% in a second five-year
period.  Feenstra said the Enron plants all can be
converted to combined-cycle for use over ex-tended
periods.<\s>Take a look at the California send out numbers for 11/15 and 11/16.  We're

     Duncan.  ""OPALCO members have been among the first to show a high
     level of interest in power that is non-polluting.""

     BEF said it is funding watershed projects that use solar power to
     pump water for cattle and irrigation while protecting streams. The
     group was founded in 1998 to fund new renewable energy resources and
     watershed restoration projects.  Although BEF maintains a strong
     collaborative relationship with the Bonneville Power
     Administration, they are separate organizations.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  Les can also be a helpful 
resource on this.

Cheers,
Jesse<\s>Group,

If any schedules are cut that are EPE generation, we need to handle it in a 
specific way.  Our first attempt should always be to make the downstream 
marketer sell the energy at PV (or wherever the cut is) just like we would on 
any Enron schedule.  Be forceful and do not simply agree to back down 
generation.  It was a firm sale and it is their power.  However, if they 
cannot find a home for the power, or are unwilling to, tell them you will be 
forced to sell it for them and let them know that they would most likely get 
a higher price than you would, as they have more interest in that price.  If 
all else fails, you may book out the schedules by backing down EPE gen.  If 
you do this, the price you buy the energy back at must be lower than the 
generation cost.  EPE is never pleased when we buy back a firm schedule for a 
price higher than the gen cost.  If you do bookout a schedule, show it as a 
purchase in the EPE model with a comment as to what it is.  If you have any 
questions about the cuts or correct enpower procedure, ask Bill or myself.  

Thanks
Jesse<\s>Hey,

I just wanted to let you know there were three people who were responsible 
for the changes that Virginia was forced to make for Feb, and you were one of 
them.  As you can see below, the errors included counterparty changes, volume 
changes, deal extensions and even adding missing deals all together.  I'm 
forwarding you this as a STRONG reminder to make sure you have entered 
everything carefully and accurately.  As a group we need to ensure every deal 
is done right from start to finish.  Virginia is getting tired of fixing our 
sloppy mistakes and I am getting tired of hearing about them!

Changes Affecting All:

	Index Option :

1)  When the delivery point is in the same region as the index,  and it does not have a basis associated with it, the deal is evaluated as a Forward Start deal type per Research's specification and user approval of Matthew Motley.

2)  When the delivery point is in the same region as the index, but with a basis, the deal is evaluated as a Basis Option as the scenario where the delivery point is in a different region from the index.  This is a change from last release.


Changes Affecting East:

For East and all its mirrored portfolios, there will be no blending of volatilities. Monthly Options will use the Monthly Volatility, and Daily Options with Daily Volatility. The same is applied for Volatility Smile.  Before that, we applied different rules to selective option deal types.


Swaption Volatility Curve - PortCalc can now evaluate Swaption based on its own Swaption Volatility Curve instead of the one entered per deal. This feature can be selected on the PortCalc window. If Curve Volatility is used, it would be for ALL Swaption deals in that Post ID.


Changes Affecting EES:

RETAILEAST portfolio evaluation is mirrored the same as EAST. 


Changes Affecting Renewable:

Delivery Point - PortCalc will now use the Delivery Point as the Delivery Point description instead of the",mail_10620,mail_10620,True

Brandon
Healy. Applewhite's TD pass to Johnson was a short screen up the middle and
Johnson just ran away from all the pursuit. Starting safety Greg Brown
intercepted one of Applewhite's throws on the second-team's first
possession.
Brown still wouldn't give any hint about who will be his starting QB in the
season opener next week, but did say both QBs played well. Brown also said,
""I was really pleased with the wide receivers. I thought they made some
steps
in running better routes and making the tough catches.""
He also said Ike is clearly the No. 2 TB behind Mitchell at this point.
Redshirt freshman Ivan Williams had a great spring, but has not been
dominating during the current practices. He also has had some nagging
injuries. Brown said Ike, the fastest of the tailbacks, has been doing well
in practice. ""Victor has been doing the best since he's been here,"" Brown
said. ""He is doing much better without the ball (blocking) than he has in
the
past.""
* * * *
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese, who has nine starters back, says he is
feeling better about his new defensive ends. ""I've got four guys I think
can
play,"" Reese said. ""Cory Redding and Jermain Anderson are the starters, and
Kaelen Thornton has really been doing a good job. He just keeps getting
better, so he'll be the first backup for Anderson, and Cole Pittman has had
three solid scrimmages in a row, so  he'll be the guy behind Redding. I
think
all four of them will play a lot, and they're the four main ones right
now.""
Thornton, a true freshman, is one of the larger DEs at about 6-3, 270, but
Reese  said he is ""pretty quick out there. He gets a good rush from the
edge,
and that's what we like. He also is learning to do a better job against the
run.""
He said Pittman, who was moved over from tackle to provide better run
support, ""has been doing a good job against the run, and he's a pretty good
pass rusher, too. I think we'll be okay with those four guys as soon as
they
get a little more experience","on its home page (it will appear in print this Friday).

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO,"" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company","ri, the California Energy Commission's manager of renewable energy, acknowledged similar concern. But he said some renewable ventures should be able move ahead.

""These projects can last 20 or 30 years,"" he said, noting that the state's power purchases will peak in the next two to three years and then decline, making room for other power providers.

Green-Energy Firms Seek New Contract Talks

State policy still encourages renewable energy projects, Masri said, providing about $135 million a year in various incentives. The money is raised through a 30-cent monthly fee in residential electricity bills.

Though the subsidies are helpful, they are of little use if the renewable companies can't find customers for their energy. That's why John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology in Sacramento, would like the state to negotiate its way out of enough of the long-term power purchases to open the market to alternative power ventures.

""If there is not some renegotiation of the long-term contracts the state has signed, we fear there will be a green-energy blackout,"" White said.

Indeed, there already is something close to a green-energy blackout. About 96% of new energy generation in California through 2007 will be from natural gas-fired plants, according to the California Energy Commission.

Although Gov. Gray Davis and S. David Freeman, chairman of the state's power authority, have in the past been friendly to green power, White said it is their appointees who have thwarted industry expansion. And this is taking place as the cost of producing renewable energy is falling.

Wind power, for example, has fallen from 18 cents a kilowatt-hour in the 1980s to about 5 cents, a price competitive with other forms of electricity, said Masri of the energy commission.

""Davis and Freeman talk the talk when it comes to renewable energy, but judging by the actions of the state they have not walked the walk,"" said Jonathan Weisgall, spokesman for MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., the parent of CalEnergy.

Documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that state power officials balked at signing renewable energy generators to long-term contracts at a time when they were negotiating with the traditional providers.

In April, MidAmerican offered a 20-year contract to sell 380 megawatts of geothermal generation from the Imperial Valley for 7.5cents a kilowatt-hour. Much of the generation would have come",mail_2039,mail_3935,False

Again we have excess on our account today with EDF Man.  When I called to confirm, Paul tells me that no money with be transfered.  Total amount of excess is $24,296,123.00.  
 
Please call me if any questions or concerns.

You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.

Ninth Circuit held that union protesters have a First Amendment right to

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=
is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=
cot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at=
 their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=
c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =
for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=
d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark=
 also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=
ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,=
  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=

Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =
Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =
a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=
ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =
imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=

Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=
pes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment=
"" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comme=

Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=

Rabon in the October 6th meeting.

of the legislation cited the rising costs of obtaining outside professional

The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.

this.  Especially to try and learn what SOCO is saying about Native Load

Finally, SOCO seems to say only one control area.  Is this right?

YES, ONLY ONE CONTROL AREA IS WHAT THEY PROPOSE, BUT WILL ALLOW MORE THAN 
ONE.  I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE TELLING THE OTHER POTENTIAL PARTIES THAT THE ONLY 
WAY THEY GET ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE RTO AT A POSTAGE STAMP RATE IS TO AGREE TO 
ONE CONTROL AREA.  NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRIORITY OF BUNDLED RETAIL.  
LOOKS LIKE THEY GET NONE, JUST PROTECTION FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASE

Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.

The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.

Wall Street joins the energy players 
By Les Blumenthal 
Bee Washington Bureau 
(Published June 9, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- Wall Street's interest in the West Coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some Manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for much-needed generating plants. 
Morgan Stanley, which earned more than $5.5 billion last year, has quietly purchased a major share of one of the Bonneville Power Administration's huge transmission lines that link California with the Pacific Northwest. 
The $18 million deal caught Bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Morgan Stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the so-called inter-tie to ship power purchased in the Southwest for sale to utilities in Washington state and Oregon. 
Although most of the attention in the Western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from Texas and other Southern states, Morgan Stanley ranks among the 15 largest power marketers in the nation, according to reports filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Morgan Stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators in 1995, the first Wall Street firm to take such a step. 
Merrill Lynch also is registered with the commission. 
""Wall Street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities, including energy,"" said Judy Hitchen, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman in New York. 
But many in the utility industry said they","hadn't realized Morgan Stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading. 
""I wasn't aware of it,"" Mark Crisson, superintendent of Tacoma Power, said of Morgan Stanley's purchase of capacity on the inter-tie. ""It shows how things are changing."" 
And in Congress, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Morgan Stanley's direct involvement in West Coast electricity markets wasn't all that surprising. 
""It's wonderfully lucrative for a few folks,"" DeFazio said. ""This is the big new game. It's the new world of deregulated energy."" 
Bonneville has four major transmission lines linking California and the Northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of Seattle. The lines were built by the federal government, are operated by the transmission arm of BPA and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that Bonneville could hog the region's power grid. 
Morgan Stanley now controls about one-third of the lines' total northbound capacity, or about 1,145 megawatts, until February 2002. 
Then its share drops to just over 700 megawatts until March 2003. BPA and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity. 
""They sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date,"" said Shepard Buchanan, a spokesman for BPA's transmission side. ""No one had ever made a long-term purchase of that (transmission) path before. It had never come up before."" 
Under federal regulation, BPA had no choice but to accept the Morgan Stanley bid. 
The transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand. Though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit, theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market.

""We are concerned,"" he said. ""We don't want anyone gaming the market by controlling the (transmission) system. We will keep a close eye on Morgan Stanley and others.""

Steve,

Here is my updated cashflow for the TW Red Rock project.  Please use this for your year end projections.

Thanks,
Steve Kalmus<\s>I would hope so.  I am not sure when Barney communicated the budget to you.  We don't usually use what Corp gives us for bonuses, because they don't really know.  We ususally use what we paid out previously.

I think it is a good idea to state our position on Annex V and to take this 
chance to reaffirm our belief in the following 4 basic principles:

1. Contract sanctity (Annex V holds, all contracts hold)
2. No caps on spot prices (if Brazil still wants to attract private funds in 
new generation)
3. Pass through of MAE price at LDC level for end-user consumption above 
their respective quota
4. Brazil needs MAE to settle: make it work.  Only way: reinforce credit 
worthiness of all MAE members.

Shell Says Enron Vindicates Management Style

    The Enron crisis has changed the way analysts view Royal 
Dutch/Shell, silencing critics who once dismissed the it as an 
anachronism in an era of fast-paced energy traders, according to 
Shell Chairman Phil Watts at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates 
conference. Two or three years ago there was a fad and a fashion 
about and we were being criticized for being a bit too conservative, 
a bit too slow, a bit too capital-intensive, he said. Watts rejects 
the suggestion that Shell's large cash resources need to be spent. 
However, he says that the company has made it absolutely clear that 
acquisitions, divestments, mergers as well as organic growth are all 
part of the number of opportunities that we can take to grow value in 
the company. Watts described Shell as a believer in oil industry 
consolidation.

In response to your question re: how the VA cogen deal affects the supply contract with the GSA, I have prepared the attached analysis.  Part I focuses on the cogen deal; part II shows the affect of a new DSM project I'm trying to close by end of December.  Please note that this analysis is a back of the envelop analysis that gives you a logic and scope which can now be fine tuned by the appropriate analyst group.

The net result is that the existing cogen deal and the proposed new energy deal provides the EES commodity desk 67mm kWh it can market as Negawatts.  Based upon assumptions from Enron On Line, the market value of these negawatts is $1.5mm.  EFS will be happy to discuss with the desk how we can share this benefit.

Bill<\s>Richard,

Here is my first take on the analysis you wanted and acc't numbers.

Please do not show this to anyone before we talk.  I need to get to a meeting in Boston now so I don't have time to write something up which I need to do.  So please keep this just between us.  I'll call you this afternoon.

For December we should have scheduled 363289 to ECS.

We Scheduled 250000.

Therefore, as of the end of December, we still need to schedule an additional 113289.

So far 15000 was scheduled for 1/2/02 and 11000 will be scheduled for the 3rd.

I did not receive any official numbers this month as to how much we owed ENA for January, so that still needs to be figured out.

Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month.

Subject:	Outside Professional Services

	Shelley, we have been working with a number of Business and IT managers with the termination of IT Consultants.  In some cases, major IT projects have been cancelled and consultants have been eliminated.  There is one project at ETS, the rewrite of the contracts system, that was being staffed by some outside IT consultants ( Valtech).  Has that project been put on hold or discontinued?  If it has and the consultants are no longer here, GSS needs to be in the loop to send termination letters to the supplier.  There is specific termination language in the Master Services Agreements that we manage.  

	Please let me know the status to the project or direct me to the person who can help me.

 TFE  Total Firm Entitlement Penalty

  18-21 97,743 @ $5.6684 = $554,050.00

   Total Overrun on both contracts and penalty due to market area 
restrictions when overrun occurred.

******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************
****************
1) Enron NA was never notified by TCO of any penalty, overrun on VNG contract 
or pipeline OFO situation during the November 18-21 time period.

2) Denise Dotson was notified by VNG gas control on the morning of November 
20th about the overrun situation above.  The VNG gas control experienced  the 
problem but did not notify Enron or AGL until Monday morning.

3) Enron immediately placed ranking system in Navigator to make VNG first 
priority.  This was completed Monday afternoon November 20th.

4) On Tuesday morning 11/21, Denise Dotson once again called Enron stating 
that the previous night VNG attempted to pull maximum  volumes from   storage 
contracts only to overrun contract due to ENA nominations to other delivery 
points.  Joann Collins called her Columbia team and was told that the  
ranking was not applicable after the last confirmation cycle on any gas day 
with no-notice contracts.  Ranking has zero effect with the late night   
schedulers.

5) Enron dropped the Hopewell nomination from the VNG contract(s) effective 
11/22.

128,"make a few additional requests of you:

1.  Please refrain from any non-essential Internet use.   As our team is connected back to Internet access, it is absolutely critical that we not re-infect company computers.  Please avoid use of any non-essential business sites, including news, shopping, financial, games, etc, whether at your desk or dialed in to company computers through VPN.  If you have a question about the appropriateness of a site, please consult with a team advisor.   Some groups may be disabled from Internet access altogether for the immediate term to ensure the reliability of critical systems.  This is a serious issue for Enron.  If our team re-infects company computers it will impact the long-term ability of our group to have Internet access.

2. Make sure that customer calls are answered.  The demands of system outages, testing and moving are weighing heavy on all of us.   I know that you have gone to great lengths to answer customer calls these last few days.  I need for you to continue that level of customer phone service.  Each customer team needs to ensure that customer calls are answered by a live representative and do not roll to phone mail.  This is the level of service that we have committed to deliver to our customers and we will have to find a way to keep this promise despite our move and other demands.

3. Smile and know that you are appreciated.  It seems like everywhere we turn these last few weeks we are confronted with bad news -- national events, Internet viruses, the stock market.   Perhaps it is trivial, but I wanted to make sure to tell you how much I appreciate what you do.  I feel proud to be part of this team and even prouder of the way that we pull together during tough times.  I also wanted to tell you that we are planning a fun celebration for our team in the near future -- details to follow soon.

Chris/Dave -

Starting at 5pm today, the EGM Fundamentals sites will only be accessible to EGM employees.  Should anyone in the gas world wish to access the sites, an eRequest will need to be submitted for consideration.  Users can find EGM Fundamentals in eRequest by selecting Applications and then searching on EGM.  The second option, ""egm Fundy Website Users"" should be selected.

basis and Enron will have the remainder of the contract MDQ.

Assuming normal system demand at DPL, Enron should have from 70,000 to 95,000 
of this SST contract during the month of April.

ECONOMIC NOTE:

Enron will not have to pay any variable cost (demand or commodity) to Dayton 
until the cumulative usage of the SST contract by DPL and Enron reaches 
9,239,520 /dth.  Based on the historical data compiled by Columbia during the 
course of the asset management deal, this 9.2 dth figure  will not be hit 
until sometime in June or early July.

It is to our advantage to fill this contract up to the max. allowed by DPL on 
a daily basis until this 9.2 figure comes into play.   It is an immediate 
saving of the commodity charge, which will be about $0.015.

I can provide a copy of the actual contract for your review upon request.

Tips & Tricks
Cutting out just a few little steps now can save you heaps of time in the long run.

	
Customize Your Synchronization
You can shave time off your HotSync operation by only synchronizing the programs you actually use. Don't use the Expense application? Never read your email on the road? Don't waste precious synchronization time. Just open the Palm Desktop, choose the HotSync drop-down menu, and click Custom. You'll get a list of all the applications that synchronize. Simply change the ones you no longer need from Synchronize the files to Do Nothing and you're ready to start saving time!

Set Time Dialogue Box
When you're setting the time of an event with the Set Time dialogue box, you don't have to navigate up and down the vertical hour and minute bars. You can just tap the Start Time or End Time box and use your Graffiti pad to enter the times.

 Enron Canada bids a fond farewell to Jon McKay who is heading back to the =

Effective today, John Zufferli will be assuming responsibility for Gas Trad=

 the end of 2000.  Congrats on your new role, John!



<Embedded Picture (Metafile)><\s>I tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered.  Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.  Any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool.  The only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism.  The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.  The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales)

  Chicago Sun-Times
  Many Partial, spoiled ballots
  Scott Fornek and Abdon M. Pallasch
  11/14/00

  Cook County--home of the notorious ""butterfly"" ballot--was more
  likely than any other Chicago area county to have voters who
  skipped the presidential contest on their ballots last week or
  mistakenly chose more than one candidate.

  City and suburban officials said 122,859 of the 1,987,954 people
  who cast ballots in the county either did not punch a choice in
  the top contest or spoiled their ballot for that race by punching
  more than one hole.

  In Chicago, the 72,934 ballots represented 7.1 percent of all
  ballots cast. In suburban Cook, the 49,925 ballots were 5.2 percent
  of the total.

  Comparable figures in the other five counties ranged from 0.4
  percent for McHenry to 2.5 percent for Will, according to a Chicago
  Sun-Times analysis of last week's vote.

  Election officials in Cook County conceded the numbers were higher
  than normal. But they could not provide an explanation for the
  discrepancy or a breakdown, so it was impossible to tell if the
  absence of votes was largely voluntary or a problem voters had
  with the ballots.

I need to get some hard evidence (paperwork) that subtantiates the gain collected by Eco Holdings on the LPG hedging contracts for the year 2000. I do have copies of the contracts, but for audit purposes we need to have probably the worksheet where we signed off with Enron as to the amounts collected. Who can I talk to to get this?<\s>Jimmy,

This must have confirmed Enron's belief that there is really no chance of it ever being allowed to settle down at Dabhol to a normal business relationship with the Maharashtra government, the state's political parties, and the state electricity board. There is too much history and baggage - starting with the original project's go-ahead against advice from the World Bank and others, and continuing with the way that Bal Thackeray was suddenly converted to the virtues of Dabhol's second 1,440MW phase stage after he met Rebecca Mark, a senior Enron executive. 
Then there were blockages on Enron's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales, followed by the Nagpur attacks, and damming statements issued since then by the Maharashtra government. Now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation, lenders' meetings, government meetings, and often contradictory newspaper reports. Seemingly forgotten is the basic fact that Enron's senior executive in India obtained authority last month from Dabhol's board to terminate the project if matters do not improve. 
For him not to act on that, India presumably needs to show good faith that it wants to resolve all the disputes quickly. But insisting, as the state government has done, that the interim report of the Godbole committee of inquiry on the dispute should be the starting point for re-negotiating the power purchase agreement is scarcely a conciliatory start. 
The best solution of course would be for Enron's 65 per cent stake in Dabhol to be bought out by a another power company which would then, with bankers and lenders, renegotiate the power purchase agreement, lower the rate of return, restructure $2 billion debt, and arrange to sell power across to states outside Maharashtra. 
Many foreign power companies have looked at the project, which looks attractive because the 2,144 MW power plant is almost completed, whereas most other big power projects have not even started construction, and because there is a large liquefied natural gas terminal which will be one of the first in the country. But no foreign company wants to pick up the risks and uncertainties involved. That leaves the possibility of an India buyer - with Reliance being frequently mentioned as the most likely candidate because of its proven financial","Victoria Hale

Yankees Have a Plan to Beat Arizona's Heat

The Yankees' ability to generate runs against Curt Schilling
and Randy Johnson  or at least force them out of the game
in the late innings  will probably determine whether New
York will win another World Series.

The Final Act in a Season of Turmoil

One of the burgeoning undercurrents of this 97th World

assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is my 
understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your 
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices up 
when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.

Subject: Our tree trimming storey.....



Bryan and I decided to start putting up the Christmas decorations this
week.  Sunday, we got the tree out of the closet and set that up in the
living room.  Our plan was to do a little bit every night.  By
Thanksgiving, we would have a beautifully decorated house.  On Monday,
Bryan put the lights on the tree.  Then I started unwrapping some of the
ornaments.... just to look at them.  Well, after I unwrapped *all* of
the
ornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree.  Bryan was hanging
back
and letting me do most of the decorating.  Though I did notice that one
of
the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole
ornament.  After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights
and
admired our tree.  That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find
my
NEW ornament.  He had put something new on one of the trees.  (we have a
charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.)
I
could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the
big
tree.

After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me
said,
""Look for a ring, look for a ring"".  But the practical side of me said,
""Find the ornament"".  Well, just about then I found a beautiful diamond
ring hanging from the heart shaped Nicole ornament.  My engagement ring
had
been on the tree the entire time.  I was so focused on the decorating
that
I never saw it.  Bryan has since been teasing me",mail_783,mail_3774,False

Wanted to touch base to make sure that CNRL signs agency papers, preferably before we do the release on PGT's electronic board. Gerald Nemec is our attorney and he has put together language surrounding our responsibilities for other agency deals. As I understand, we will mangage all aspects of the transporation agreement which includes review of invoices and the ability to net transportation charges from the supply payment. 

Please advise if you need assistance from either Gerald or me in this regard.

Thanks,

Stephanie<\s>Since this deal involves cash out the door, we have hit a temporary roadblock. We may find another party that is willing to guarantee our payment obligation if we fail to pay..

Please call tomorrow..

Subject: Metals Recycling action

I have discussed further with Joe.

Update on  African deal

We are still awaiting confirmation on the background checks for the 
counterparty - it seems unlikely that there is any link to government 
agencies.

There is no proof that the Recycling management in Hamburg gave any direct 
authorisation on this deal.  They do not see anything particularly wrong with 
it either - to them this is completely different to the Indian deals as they 
were not involved with preparing the documentation, merely accepting it from 
a third party.  They see the car purchase (second hand Toyota) as a simple 
payment mechanism rather than a bribe.

The instructions that they gave to their team in October was to cease all of 
the Indian deals - they seem not to have applied an ethical motive to this, 
but more a specific dictate covering India.  

Doug Imrie is currently reviewing all other international deals and is 
working through with Stephan Scheppler (the Manager of the Frankfurt office), 
what will and will not be acceptable going forward. A list of written 
instructions will be issued following this review. 

We do not believe that any action against Stephan Scheppler will help to 
achieve anything in terms of improvement in management going forward.  Under 
German law it would probably be very difficult to prove that he has acted 
against instructions (indeed he does not seem to have received the right","yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy<\s>Brenda

It strikes me that the planning documentation could be enormously useful to 
us in backtesting our existing processes and determining any potential 
overlaps

Is there any obstacle to access to this information?

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my ""To Do"" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a ""Blueprint"" of EIM major",mail_1387,mail_1387,True
153,"In Feb  CERA  has  its  Houston Executive  Conference.  If  we have  a  
rough  winter  that  could  be  great timing
for  Enron  to  use this  as a Problem Solving and Policy Setting Forum  for 
a  high level   'how  to'  Workshop --and/or   invite  in  some  natural  gas 
and electricity  end  users  and/or  gas distributor speakers  from  the   
buy side that  ""did it  right""  and  can  talk  about   how they  hedged  or  
set  up their  portfolios    to make it  successfully through a  tough  
winter market.  Security  analyst speakers talking  about   doing it the  
right  way  would also be  useful.

My   thought  is  that   Item   2.    sending  the  Trends  publications   
coupled with   brief  multi media  messaging
(from  Item 3) might  give us the bigger   impact  faster and more  
targeted   than  the others.  

 Do any of  these  appeal   to  you ?

http",".  STORAGE  COSTS   Putting  gas into storage for  a  several month period  
typically costs  50 cents  to  $1.00 per  MCF or more; 

B.  GAS COSTS   This cost  becomes  too  high to  put  gas into storage   
when average  U.S.  prices  start rising because  the  need  to USE  the gas 
itself,  not store  it,   becomes  greater than the need  to put it into 
storage and pay storage  costs   for  future  needs.   

For  example    at  $2.00 plus  50 cents  or   $1.00 for heat season storage 
this cost combination is typically economic;   but  the situation becomes 
cost prohibitive  when demand in the market for gas  is  so great to USE it  
that it moves  the price  to   $3.00  or more  or as high as   $4.60  --  to 
which  one would  then also have to  add   50 cents or  another dollar to 
store it.

  PNT_OF",", but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a ""US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART""  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

""This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices.""

Sean,

The language is below",mail_3291,mail_3043,False
155,"the Form 8-K and Press Release.

Marc Manly called this evening to indicate that he will try to get Business Review Committee (BRC) sign-off on the Transaction by the end of the day tomorrow (hopefully earlier), followed by a short NPW Board meeting or, in lieu thereof, the circulation of a Unanimous Written Consent.  I questioned whether the Enron directors should recuse themselves from the Board meeting ( I believe they should do so, although they could be present for quorum purposes) and how any recusal would affect a Consent (in lieu of a Board meeting).  Joe, do you have any thoughts here, given the circumstances.  In addition, Marc and I have signed-off on the BRC resolutions (which are being circulated for execution), and I will review tonight the latest draft of the Board resolutions that I just received.

I am providing a copy of this E-Mail to Mark Koenig for his information from an Enron IR perspective.

Regards,
Robert

Robert:

     I attach the current versions of a form 8-K and associated press
release, assuming the Business Review Committee and the Board approve the
transactions.  Gene is reviewing these documents and may have additional
comments.  Please provide any comments and I will recirculate another draft
reflecting all comments received.  As indicated in the 8-K, we would intend
to include the press release as a filed exhibit to the 8-K.

     We are attempting to finalize the underlying deal documents tonight so
that they may be submitted to the BRC.  Unless there is a problem with
using resolutions by unanimous consent (e.g., the Enron directors must
recuse themselves and thus the resolutions can only pass by means of a live
board meeting), we are tending toward board action by unanimous consent.
We will explore if that is a problem, and if so, will call a telephonic
meeting at the earliest time we can obtain a quorum.","affiliate, operated a propane/air d=

I was in Zurich on Friday and had an interesting discussion with Mauro 
Renggli - head of our office there. The discussion and
suggestions (below) were wholly at Mauro's instigation.

Over the past several months, Viviana has been tracking development in the 
Swiss market and providing updates etc. to Mauro and his 
team. He seems quite pleased with the work she is performing for him and has 
asked if I would be supportive of Viviana transferring to 
the Zurich office for 3+ months to work with his team. I told him I would 
think about it. From my perspective, this may be a very useful
step: 1) It allows her to get closer to a market she is already tracking for 
reg. affairs and which is headed for some important developments
ove the coming 6 months, 2) she is already a known and appreciated quantity 
there, and 3) most importantly, she would be able to 
work more closely with the small team there and perhaps get some of the 
additional support and guidance that I have not been able to 
provide.  Viviana has apprarently already voiced her interest in working in 
Switzerland.

Can you please call me before you speak to Viviana. Would welcome your take 
on this.

Thanks, Paul<\s>Peter

We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is 
really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might 
require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right 
to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they 
want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we 
would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable 
basis.","deal.  Please keep this number in confidence.  In addition, we have budgeted about $120,000 for the insurance product to increase the liability of EAMR from $140,000 to $1,000,000.

Can you please advise me as to the feasibility of 1) or 2) above?  If there is no way we are going to get there, I need to know fairly quickly so I can explore other options.  If it is possible, which of the above 2 approaches is better from you perspective?

Citizens will be here today at 3:00 pm.  I would greatly appreciate some feedback from you by that time.

To contact me please call Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 and she will be able to find me.

UBS Wins Apparent Control of Enron's Trading Operations


    Swiss bank UBS Warburg is the apparent winner of an auction for
control of Enron's energy trading unit. If the bankruptcy judge accepts
UBS bid, it would mean a venture into a new area of business for UBS, the
investment banking arm of the Swiss bank trades in commodities,
derivatives, and other instruments but not oil and natural gas. The value
of the winning bid or other details were not disclosed. As part of the
deal, Enron would retain a residual interest in the income of the business
but UBS would assume none of Enron's","Subway??---Christie may remember better 
than I do since she wanted me to go with her and I couldn't.)

Good to hear from you!!  I think about you often and still have an old 
picture of you in one of my wallets.  :)

I am currently sitting in a hotel room in Orlando, FL.  I have been here 
working (spokesmodel for IBM and some of it's affiliates) and am very ready 
to fly home tomorrow.  It has not been the best trip I've ever had, but I'm 
sure it's not the worst either.  I now live in Los Angeles about 90% of the 
time and Central Texas about 10% of the time.  Not really enough time in 
Texas for my taste, but that's the way it is for now.  My Dad and Helen 
(wife---wonderful woman) live out near Lake Travis in that house he's had 
since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
in TX.

I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.

What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....

Hope to hear from you soon...

Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)

Love,

163,"economics  
for any potential power plant  developers  who might  be out there 
considering building  a  plant  in C alifornia.  Many   US power markets  
have no  price  caps  at all or  caps  of   $1000 MW  (or high  enough  so 
they are  seldom  triggered.)  Not  California.

CALIFORNIA'S  WOES AREN'T  EASY  TO  FIX
What  does  this  all mean?  If  California  had listened  to Enron it  
would  have avoided   the severe problems  it has today--- lack of  new 
plants, lack of  market oriented power prices, rate caps that discourage 
sellers and developers alike and irate customers.  It would have had no 
automatic  rate  cut and consumers  would  know  when their  costs  were  
going  up or  down.   The  State  would use bilateral contracting to  get 
its  supplies  so if  Duke  or  Enron  or  Exelon or  Dynegy  or whoever  had 
contracts  with counterparties  the prices  would  be  variously  set  and  
if more  power  demand was evident, developers  would  have  a clear 
economic  basis  on which to contract for their new plants.  There would be  
no need for  price  caps. 

NOT IN MY  BACKYARD  OR  YOURS  EITHER!!
 On  the  power plant siting  problem, this is a tough one. California is  a 
beautiful state and prides itself on its  green conscience. Even  a few  high 
tech companies that need 99.9999 percent reliable  power desparately  are 
still  unwilling  to  build a small clean gas combined cycle plant inside 
their own fence.  So we do not know  how California   can resolve  siting 
problems   as it is   a quirk of the state  that  says  give me lots more 
cheap,  environmentally clean power  but  don't  build any plants here  in my 
state to do it.<\s>In","case you have not seen.....Margaret<\s>HI my art  website  is   www.geocities.com/margaret_site  and  I have  some

The Tariff also provides that the Underscheduling Penalty will be distributed to SCs whose actual demand exceeds scheduled demand by less than a 5%.  ISO Tariff Section 2.2.13.2.3.3.  Underscheduling Penalty Revenues are distributed as Charge Type 1480.  Here is a handout from the ISO explaining the charge.  

 

Procedural background:  On December 8, 2000, the ISO filed a Tariff change with FERC in which the ISO proposed a penalty that would be assessed against Scheduling Coordinators that underscheduled load, i.e., actual demand exceeded scheduled demand.  This Amendment 33 was adopted by FERC in its December 15, 2000. Order.  In March, the ISO filed Tariff Amendment 38, asking that the Underscheduling Penalty be suspended.  The ISO noted that in its transmittal letter accompanying its filing that ""Most of the shortfall in the amount of forward scheduled Load is attributable to PG&E and SCE....From January 1, 2001 to March 14, 2001, the ISO estimates that the penalties will exceed $400 million.""  Page 4, Transmittal Letter for Amendment 38 to the ISO Tariff, submitted to FERC on March 20, 2001.

FERC rejected the ISO's request to suspend the penalty, and so the ISO reluctantly calculated the amounts that would be due to each SC.

The ISO has informed us that we are due $33.8 million.  Here is the spreadsheet the ISO sent us.   And this is the letter regarding PG&E claims that accompanied this spreadsheet.   

Unfortunately, the CAISO's information does not show us how much of the amount is attributable to PG&E.  I called the CAISO this morning, and was told that others have been requesting this breakout of information.  The ISO's response was that it would be impossible for it to determine how much of the PX's penalty was attributable to PG&E---and therefore it was not going to rerun the settlements.  I told them that the PX only scheduled power for 17 days while the penalty was in effect and that we would still be interested in seeing what PG&E owed for the period of January 18 to present.  They are taking this under consideration and promised to",mail_1139,mail_4667,False

Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Looking for a health habit that turns back the clock? Recent <br>research reveals that exercise may literally wipe away years <br>of aging.
<br><br>
In the study, a small group of middle-aged men who undertook<br>
a 6-month program of moderate exercise regained the level<br>
of cardiovascular fitness they had enjoyed as healthy <br>
20-year-olds at the beginning of the study. The exercise <br>program reduced their heart rates and improved the ability <br>of their bodies to use oxygen.

Guys,

I received a call from Mike Garred, admin for The New Power Company, wanting 
to confirm that his company is properly set up in EOL ---- everything is fine 
from our end.  What does this customer need to do to get credit?

Thanks,
Griff<\s>We have not done any recent analysis since the end of January or maybe even 
the end of December.  I will have Rod Nelson and Tanya Rohauer relook at the 
impact of the changing yield curve on Credit Reserve.

We have a lot of improvements we need to make on our current methodology when 
we have the time and resources to dedicate to it.

Subject: Credit reserve update

Bill,

Most recent Vincent's update on what's going on with the credit  model.

Another issue. I am increasingly concerned with our general approach to the 
generation
of probabilities of default. Recent developments in the credit markets are 
likely to
change completely the dynamics and levels of  interest rate spreads. I am 
curious if
you looked at the credit reserve based on the current yield curves (as of the 
last few days).

Vince

See attached for our changes.  I am typing the Annex IV stuff now  - it has 
to do with Sections 26.4 and 26.5 - resolution of certain Purchaser-Agent 
Disputes.  We also will need to put in the currently-being-negotiated 
assignment language, so the bank knows that they have access to their

Impressions, Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 1984, p. 32).

In a survey of 1700 professing Christian teenagers, 70 percent
admitted to hearing voices, like there was a subconscious self
talking to them. I don't believe they are psychotic or paranoid
schizophrenic. There is a battle going on for their minds. I have
shared with many tormented people that they aren't going crazy
but are under spiritual attack. They usually respond, ""Praise the
Lord, someone understands."" It's freeing to know this truth,
because if there is a battle going on for our minds, we can win
that war.

Lord, today I choose to test the spirits and assume my
responsibility to think upon that which is true.

THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

Having put on the breastplate of righteousness... (Ephesians
6:14).

The second piece of armor God has provided for us is the
breastplate of righteousness. When you put on Christ at
salvation, you are justified before our holy God. It's not your
righteousness but Christ's (1 Corinthians 1:30; Philippians 3:8,
9). So when Satan aims an arrow at you by saying, ""You're not
good enough to be a Christian,"" you can respond with Paul, ""Who
will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who
justifies"" (Romans 8:33). Your righteousness in Christ is your
protection against Satan's accusations.

Even though we rejoice in our position of righteousness in
Christ, we are well aware of our deeds of unrighteousness when we
think, say, or do something apart from God. Standing firm in our
righteousness requires us to live in continuous agreement with
God according to 1 John 1:9: ""If we confess our sins, He is
faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness."" Confession is different from saying
""I'm sorry"" or asking forgiveness. To confess (homolo",mail_10635,mail_10635,True

Since Taraz seems to be the topic of conversation for so many right now, I

We adopted our son, now 3 from Taraz in August of 2000 using Kids First/Frank 
Foundation.  

In answer to alot of your questions, We flew through New Yorks JFK to Moscow, 
that flight was 10 hours long and we arrived in Moscow in mid morning and 
were brought to a hotel close to the airport to eat and rest.  Our flight to 
Almaty left at 11pm.  We arrived in Almaty after a 3 hour time difference and 
I believe the flight was about 3 hours as well, so it was about 4am Almaty 
time.  Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our 
coordinator, the sun was just coming up.  We then went to her flat to rest 
some more and eat breakfast.  (Although it seems like we had alot of time to 
rest, it was worth it to lay down as much as possible and relax to help us 
adjust to the time change)  We then went to the bank to get money that had 
been wired to us and then got our tickets for the train ride for that night.

What are we intending to get from them that would not relate to an EOL transaction?  If we believe we will discuss other matters than EOL with them, them I do not have a problem being a bit broad; however, if it is only EOL, then we should be specific.

my style at Enron was very different from the reputation of the company(

Do not send any HA 24 schedules that you do not intend to send.  In other 
words, remove all schedules that are not the specific ones you want to send.  
We have been sending zero schedule when we don't want to be.  If we go back 
to only sending our HA 24 schedules, we can avoid this problem.

Thanks

I have spent the day working with Kathy at EPE to correct the models for last 
week.  Every day from 17th through 20th (so far) has had formula errors.  
There is absolutely no excuse for this.  Check the formulas to ensure they 
are correct before emailing it to EPE every day.  It is an easy thing to fix 
and failure to so makes us look bad.

Jesse<\s>Group,

I have Blazer tickets for 11/28 (Tuesday night after Thanksgiving) against 
Seattle.  I have to work and would rather just let someone else go, rather 
than attempt to get the night off.  If someone wants to go to the game and 
give me their tickets to another game, let me know.  I believe that Stan has 
the other pair that night, and has agreed to pay for ALL beer consumed.  :-)

Cheers
Jesse<\s>Unlike other transmission providers, when we buy transmission from APS, the 
Start Time and End Time are both HOUR ENDING.  According to them, they are 
""the leaders of the pack.""  So, if we want to purchase tranny for HE 14 FC to 
PV (like I did today), both the start time and end time would be 14:00.  Make 
sure that you have the right time zone as well.

        Five (5) Questions Most Feared By Men:

         1. What are you thinking about?
         2. Do you love me?
         3. Do I look fat?
         4. Do you think she is prettier than me?
         5. What would you do if I died?

         What makes these questions so difficult is that
         every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument
         if the man answers incorrectly (i.e.,tells the truth).
Therefore,
         as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along
with
         possible responses.

     ____________________________________________________

         Question # 1: What are you thinking about?

         The proper answer to this, of course, is: ""I'm sorry
         if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a
         warm,  wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you
are,
         and how lucky I am to havemet you.""

         This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true
answer,
         which most likely is one of the following:

            a. Baseball.

            b. Football.

            c. How fat you are.

            d. How much prettier she is than you.

            e. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.

         Perhaps the best response to this question was",mail_7017,mail_7017,True

Dear Alfredo,
I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte
on TPA practice, there.
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit
at a major pipeline.
Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible
example for me?
I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and
balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major
aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting
pipelines) for transmission and storage.
I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent
of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.
Thank you and best regards

Subject:	RE: EFI/DPC FMA

I don't think that the PPA will be conclusively terminated for some time, and therefore the FMA will still be in force until that time. 

However, the likelihood of us getting paid for any work we are doing, either internally or externally, is pretty low. Bearing this in mind, can you let me know wether we have any 3rd party work currently being done, any purchases outstanding and a summary of the in house personnel costs?

From this point on, I would like to keep any expenditure, including in house personnel costs, to an absolute minimum. We will not get reimbursed for any expenditure on DPC issues, and any expenses incurred should only be in conjunction with the protection of Global LNG's position.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: EFI/DPC FMA


Eric,

DPC has not sent a notice terminating the fuel management agreement. The FMA does, however, end if the PPA ends (Article 14.1 (d)). The MSEB states that they have rescinded the PPA. DPC has and will continue to challenge the MSEB's right to rescind the agreement. If the MSEB is successful in rescinding the PPA, then the biggest exposures are the Lakshmi and the lost fuel management fees. Wayne can update us on the lenders' position regarding the Lakshmi. 

I have a call in to Doug Leach to find out if any of the fuel management fees have been marked to market.

The other exposure, of course, is the in-house personnel working on DPC.

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent and $164M of property tax.

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Based upon our discussion earlier this morning and the contemplation of CL 
being CP 2 CP type product, I have modified the ESA accordingly.  The 
modification renames the ""Counterparty"" to be a ""User"" and provides that the 
""Other Agreements"" are modified only if both the User and the counterparty to 
those Other Agreements have agreed to use the Website and Modules (e.g., by 
agreeing to the ESA and Annex documents).

I want to do a bit more thinking about the viability of the amendment 
mechanism - an ESA with each counterparty to an Other Agreement - before we 
finalize this and whether or not there is a different and/or better way to 
accomplish this task.
But, in the interest of time and your schedule, I wanted you to see this for 
your review and thoughts.

If you and Tom would be comfortable with the concept of ""User"" vs. 
""Counterparty"", this would require a change to the terminology of the 
Password Application and all Annex documents.

I welcome your thoughts.

Thanks.

Below are updated versions of the ESA and Password Application.  Once the ESA 
was revised, I looked at the Password App. and realized we still had language

Lay Called Cabinet Members to Warn of Possible Bankruptcy


   Enron Chairman Lay called the secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce
departments prior to the company's collapse to warn them the company could
be in financial trouble or go bankrupt. In the call to the Treasury
secretary, Lay referenced Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that
got a $3.5 billion bailout from Wall Street which was engineered by the
Federal Reserve. Lay informed the secretary of Enron's problems and raised
the possibility that they may have an effect on credit markets similar to
that of LTCM. The secretary told Lay that he would pass the information on
to officials at Treasury who found no signs of ripple effects. Lay told
the Commerce secretary that he was worried that the decision to downgrade
Enron's bond rating would",mail_722,mail_6520,False

Dynegy Takes Over Northern Natural Gas Pipeline 

 

Dynegy, which acquired the Northern Natural Gas pipeline from Enron
after investing $1.5 billion in the energy trader, will take

over the pipelines trading and marketing today. The system, valued at
$2.7 billion, runs 16,600 miles from Texas to the Great Lakes. Enron had
contested the takeover after Dynegy backed out of its plan to buy Enron
for $23 billion in November. Earlier this month, Enron gave up the
pipeline, but is proceeding with a $10 billion lawsuit against Dynegy
for terminating their deal. Northern Natural has a capacity of 4.3 Bcf
of natural gas per day and has valuable connection points with other
pipelines. Although Dynegy operates many pipelines, Northern Natural is
their first foray into pipeline ownership. Dynegy paid $23 million to
complete the purchase and named Daniel Dienstbier as the systems
president, a position he held before becoming president of Enron's Gas
Pipeline Group in 1985. Dynegy also assumed $900 million of Northern
Natural's debt. Enron employees will run and maintain Northern Natural
until Enron's option to buy it back expires June 30th. But most think
that is unlikely to happen, given Enron's current state of affairs. 

 

FERC Approves Tuscarora Pipeline Expansion

 

The  has given final approval to Tuscarora Gas Transmission's plan to
expand its pipeline system to bring more natural gas to industrial
customers in northern Nevada. The Tuscarora natural gas pipeline was
built in 1995 in a partnership between Sierra Pacific Resources and
TransCanada PipeLines. The $60 million, 14-mile pipeline extension would
almost double the capacity in the area from 125 MMcf per day to 220 MMcf
per day. The expanded pipeline capacity will serve Duke Energy's 540 MW
plant near Wadsworth, Nevada and Morgan Stanley's 360 MW power plant
near Reno. The 229-mile pipeline stretches from Malin, Oregon through
northern California to Sierra Pacific's Tracy power station near Reno. 

 

Bob Brooks","to Tampa. Duke and Williams, which had been developing a competing
project, agreed earlier this month to buy Coastal's pipeline. Terms
were not disclosed. Coastal's purchase was for the 36-inch diameter
pipeline to run through the Gulf of Mexico and the 36-inch and 30-
inch pipe for Florida. Pipe production will start immediately with
delivery starting early next year in Port Manatee, Florida, and
Mobile. All of the pipe is scheduled for delivery by September, and
the pipeline is scheduled to start by June 2002. Coastal plans to
complete the sale of the Gulfstream system this quarter.

According to Williams' Buccaneer website, upon closure of the purchase of
Gulfstream by Williams - Duke, Gulfstream will be built in lieu of
Buccaneer.  Our next base case database will reflect this change.

Power Marketers Accused of Manipulating Prices

    Enron, PG&E Energy Trading, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing,
Sempra Energy Trading and Dynegy Power Marketing are among a dozen
energy companies accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to manipulate
California wholesale electricity prices.  The lawsuit claims
companies selling electricity in California intentionally limited
supply to drive up prices. The suit seeks certification as a class
action covering all electricity consumers in California, estimates
damages in excess of $1 billion. The allegations in the lawsuit are
based on a number of studies of the state's electricity market that
concluded it was not functioning normally. Southern California Edison
and PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric filed suit against state officials
separately last month for permission to charge customers billions of
dollars for losses from open-market power purchases.

During its October 24 meeting there was a great deal of discussion at the FERC about the role of transmission companies and the possibility that some activities should be parrcelled out to other entities to perform.  National Grid intends, later this week, to file a white paper in response to those queries.  Before doing so, however, Grid would welcome the opportuity to discuss its filing with you.  We will try to circulate at least an outline of those comments prior to meeting with you, but given the FERC's time constraints we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.  I know that Jim Steffes from Enron has spoken with at least some of you.  Based on our converstion, we have set the conference for 4:30 PM EST on Wedensday, October 31.

Maureen,

I've checked Linda Robertson's call sheet from January 2001 and do not find 
any record of incoming calls from Commissioner Hebert to Linda.
Nonetheless, she may have initiated a call TO him.

I'ved tried to reach Linda on her cell phone -- no success.  Perhaps Rick 
could raise this question with Linda when he joins her on the 11:00 AM (CDT) 
conference call today?

I'm also checking with Sarah Novosel and Joe Hartsoe -- both of whom are out 
at meetings at the present time.  When I get any responses I'll let you know.
Thanks for holding down the fort!

Subject: Re: Lag, Annex V and Rationing Figures
Richard and Jim--here are the numbers for the regulatory and Annex V issues.  I talked with Tania and Alex and the Itaipu law suit is perhaps in accurate--they are recalculating because it is more like a $15 million total impact for the 6-7 month lag. I'll send you an update.




Michelle,

Any doubts let me know.  These numbers were requested today in the car by Richard, so please let him know.  I am at your disposal for further information needed.

T?nia Calv?o.","will testify that this is a valid claim.  
Therefore under the policy, we arguably have an immediate claim for 
expropriation against OPIC, even though we haven't paid any money. To avoid 
waiving any claims, we will prepare a letter to OPIC requesting a tolling 
agreement, so we do not have to file a claim or arbitration against it within 
the period required under the policy, pending resolution of the matter.  
Given the nature of our call with them this morning, I'm sure they will 
cooperate.

I will arrange a call with Guido Tawil, our local counsel in Argentina to 
review the PPI issue, and we will analyze the commercial policy to see if we 
can find any coverage there.
Kind regards,
Michelle
