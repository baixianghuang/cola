0,", I DO!  Of course if my hair is down nobody can see it, but when it's pulled back people can see it.  I love my hair, but not in that overly-obsessive way.  And if I get in trouble I'll get mad because think about it, there are girls here who have green in their hair, and do they get in trouble??  I think not.  But then I saw a girl with the same highlights as me, except more noticeable and she had to REDYE her hair so it was brown.  And then there's this other girl who has the same highlights and she has yet to get in trouble.  There's something really wrong with this school's system of discipline.  They think 'Oh that hair's going to be distracting, better take that person in.'  When think about it, it's only going to be distracting for a day.  And if the attention lasts for over a day it's only for the people who didn't see it the first time around.  Example, I did my hair a new way last week and Nicole noticed, I did it again this week and she didn't make that much of a big deal on it.  So therefore, attention won't be spent on the hairstyle.  Who's going to be STARING at the hair, what, they want to fail?  Nah I think these teachers and school officials just want drones of themselves.  Disciplined (not), responsible (rarely probably), and quiet (when they yell at the students is that quiet??).<\s>You know the cold has gone to your head when you mix words up.   ME: I not feel very good. Yeahh... That's what I said to Nicole this morning.  So I went to go see Dawn of the Dead this weekend, while getting a NEW pair of pants a different color than the ones I already had because the OTHER pair was the same pair as Monica.  If I get a different color she won't think I'm copying her.  Dawn of the Dead was one of the weirdest movies.  Well not weirdest, but very weird.  It has a cool soundtrack only because one of the songs on it I liked because it was like that one song by Disturbed called Down with the Sickness.  Either Disturbed copied someone, or someone copied Disturbed to go along with the movie.  I shall ponder on this.

The pile of magazines in the basket - done that. And you definitely don't want to read anything about  technology, politics or Iraq.  (That seems to be getting a lot more challenging than ever.)

Anthony lets loose a ferocious scream of frustration. The DoM falls to the ground and covers his ears.   'Whaaatt de helll waas thhat?' asks Joel's alter ego, as we grabs his flask of serum and downs a little. He gets to his feet after two failed attempts.  In the corner, a mask is pulled over a face.  Anthony lets loose a couple rounds. A bunch more employees are bloodied up. The DoM reacts. He falls forward straight onto Anthony's shoes. Just enough to hold Anothony in one spot. A death cry errupts from the corner of the room.   'Oh my god, it's the guy with the abilities of a dung beetle,' Stu proclaims. It was earlier in the week Stu won a celebrity look alike contest for his Brent Butt impersonation.  'Yes it is I. Dungbeetleguy.' DBG runs over to Anthony and pushes him against the wall. He rolls Anthony into a ball. The sounds of bones snapping can be heard by the radio station upstairs. DBG finally quits rolling Anthony into a bloodied pulp. He wakes the DoM up. The DoM passed out as soon as his head his the carpet.  Evil was vanquished and a new superhero duo formed. A pair that could rival Clark Kent and Superman, weed and Rob, Dave and Bob, peanut butter and jam on bread. Villains beware! Rocky Mountain House has a pair of crime fighters who aren't smart enough to get out of your way. With the DoM as the peanut butter and DBG as the jam, they're going to make one tasty sandwich.<\s>Joel advised me about Prey for Rock and Roll. He said Gina Gershon supposedly sucked. She did. The movie did and I'm pissed off I sat through the entire thing.   If a movie has a hot girl with a tight leather outfit on the cover, it should have some nudity. The movie needed something. At least Showgirls knew enough to put naked girls in the film. The back cover of Prey for Rock and Roll even mentions a sexy thrill ride. There was no sex, no thrill and I've had better rides on donkeys.  I did however watch","off and I just listened. I countered every time he said something I didn't agree with.  The conversation ended with him complimenting me on my opinion piece. It's nice to see that I've got people talking.   (Admin's Note: In case you're curious about his editorial, I've typed it below. Yes, I have no life.)     Dane States His Case   Bertuzzi, what did you do?   On Thursday, June 24, Todd Bertuzzi was charged with assault causing bodily harm for his vicious on-ice attack directed at Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche. Moore suffered a broken neck and a concussion. It is still unknown whether he'll play next season. The incident at GM Place ocurred three and a half months ago in front of 18,000 fans.  The league acted quick and fierce. Bertuzzi was suspended for the final 13 games of the season. He missed the Canucks' seven post-season games. He lost more than $500,000 in salary. The Canucks were also fined $250,000 for the clubbing from behind. Bertuzzi wasn't selected for Team Canada at the World Hockey Championships in August, because the league hasn't reinstated Bertuzzi making him eligible to play. Now, he faces the possibility of jail time. It's too much.  The attack was terrible and deserved discipline. The league was taking care of it. Now, Bertuzzi has a lot more to worry about. The maximum penalty depends on how the Crown proceeds. Bertuzzi faces a maximum penalty of 18 months in provincial jail. Or if the Crown chooses to go the path of indictment, Bertuzzi could spend the rest of his NHL career in jail. The Supreme Court could send him away for a maximum of 10 years.  Jail time is unnecessary. Bertuzzi has been punished enough. Plus, how much punishment is going to be handed down? The Marty McSorley stick-upside-the-head incident received an 18-month conditional discharge, after being convicted of assault.  In 1998, Dino Ciccarelli was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000 Cdn. for striking Luke Richardson in the head with his stick.  One more. In 1982, Jimmy Mann, Winnipeg Jets enforcer, left the bench and clocked Penguin's Paul Gardner. Mann broke Gardner's jaw in two places. The penalty was a $500 fine and a suspended sentence.

2,"brief presentation. What a splendid idea! Beside my name it said something like:  Humanitarian globetrotter. Patient ski teacher to Vidar.  This list kept conversations going and as the evening went on it felt like I knew more and more people.  The pension where the dinner was held was very nervous because it was the biggest wedding party they had ever cooked for. They need not have worried because the food was absolutely sublime. The starter was a nice plate of various exotic mixtures of herring. The one with basilica was very tasty. This was followed by a fantastic flat fish (halibut?) and a white wine which was divine. I don't particularly like white wine but this Alsace was fantastic. Then followed a chicken with lime rice, but given that I don't eat meat I was served fresh cod instead. What a treat! The red wine was in a class of its own as well and everyone was marvelling at the food.  The toast masters made themselves known and started off the speeches. Every single speech made us laugh and cry. Every speech was very well prepared and highly interesting. And there were quite a few. The amusement factor was on top and the boredom nowhere to be seen. The one speehc which had us all in stitches was when Vidar's brother read the essay Vidar wrote about the cow when he was 8 years old. '...The cow has four legs. They are called cow legs. The cow has hair. It is called cow hair. It is brown. That's why it's called cow-lour.'And so on... I think 8-year old Vidar had been improved along the line a bit, but it sure made us laugh!  After 5 hours of sitting down it was time for coffee and a chance to move around a bit. The tables were removed so that the band could put their instruments in place. By midnight everyone was dancing and kept at it for many hours. By 3 it was time for a typical Swedish snack: Jansson's Temptation. Yummy! By 4 the band had gone to bed and the staff kicked the 30 or 40 of us still partying out of the main dining room. We continued to party in a different part of the building. In fact, this part of the building was right outside the room of the priest. Poor woman and her husban... It was raining outside so I used this as an excuse that I couldn't go back home.

I love Nima and like I've said before, I've come to this point in this relationship where I am totally comfortable with him and have all my faith and trust placed upon him.

Auntie Ivy definitely wouldn't approve dating at such a young age but whatever. I think my uncle who lives next door knows. So does my other neighbor. Haha... and the ones who live across the street!

4,"of Bonamy's story is that you can put up a damn good show of detaching yourself emotionally, but you never really can.  Of course, Bonamy is a very small part of  Jacob's Room, but I never said this site would be good with general reviews. I'm making this one personal since Bonamy's story teaches me that you can try to protect yourself by swathing your emotions in denial, but it'll hardly help you cushion the blow when the ax falls. And in my cynical mind I take this to be a lesson of 'damned if you do. Damned if you don't.' Optimistically you can believe that if you're going to be hurt anyway, why lie to yourself about how you feel? Why not shout it from the rooftops about what you love and desire? Why not? But that's an optimistic way of thought.<\s>Today is a good day. Why is it a good day? Because after an arduous month of searching for apartments and being constantly rejected by various landlords for reasons I was never told, I finally got an apartment. It's a nice apartment in an area that I wanted to live and I have laundry in the basement, which makes me practically giggle with joy. The euphoria of having this place almost makes me forget the memories of the last month of hell that I experienced. Which brings me to my review of Ms. Krauss' first novel.        Man Walks Into a Room  is the story of Samson Greene. In one life, Samson was an English professor at Columbia University. He was respected, well-liked by his students and led a happy life with his loving wife, Anne. A brain tumor, however, changes all that. The book begins with Samson getting the growth removed. The procedure, unfortunately, causes him to lose all his memories after the age of 12. He has no recollection of his wife, his job or his life past middle school. Inexplicably, Samson still has the maturity level of a middle-aged man, but he cannot recall anything from his previous adult life.       This novel for me is one of those books that you read and cherish in ways you can barely express. I love talking about it to anyone who shows the vaguest interest and I usually end up feeling incredibly emotional while expounding on the brilliance of Ms. Krauss' writing and observations. I once talked about this book during a date and couldn't stop talking, despite","Then, I hung out with Kodjo to Mr. Kebabs again.

In fact, Pat Schroeder, the former congresswoman and president of the Association of American Publishers since 1997, says, 'We need to find a way to get books into movie theaters so they can sell them along with the popcorn.'  Many exports, few imports. American authors routinely turn up on best-seller lists in other countries, but few foreign writers and translated works become best sellers in the USA. The one recent exception: One Hundred Years of Solitude, the classic by Gabriel Garca Mrquez, hit the weekly list but only after Winfrey chose it for her revived book club.  Word of mouth.

Story in full THE adventures of a large and likeable lady in Botswana might not seem like a particularly Scottish success story. But as worldwide sales of Alexander McCall Smiths No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series soar past three million, that is exactly what they have become.   The books, which feature Mma Ramotswe, a Botswanan detective, who relies on good humour and common sense to solve her cases, provide a vivid, upbeat evocation of Africa.   Critics say that their popularity is due to McCall Smiths charming, but uncomplicated, characters and his unhurried, gentle prose. Yesterday, McCall Smith told The Scotsman that he was surprised by the success of the series.   'It really is very encouraging, I am astonished by the whole thing, but really I am just delighted that so many people around the world are enjoying my books,' he said.   'Judging from some of the letters I receive from my readers, they are encouraged by the positive vision Mma Ramotswe, my central character, has. There is also very little aggression in the books; they celebrate the small things in life, like having tea and cake.

8,"I didn't respond to him either. In fact, after the rest of the day's glares and politeness, I was surprised that the man had made a comment directly about my belongingness at this particular event. During the dinner, I received several comments that I looked nice and they loved my dress. I noted one friend who had a nice sweater and nice pants on, even say that she felt'really underdressed' for the occasion... although the occasion was clearly semi-casual to casual, and not a formal affair by any means. At Thwing I ended up telling my friend Hadele, about this experiment. I really felt like telling someone about my day's experiences. She promised not to tell until the dinner was over, but was the first to admit to me that yes, my outfit was tacky and that she was shocked I didn't match my hijab to my outfit as I usually do. I realized something at that point. Throughout the day, I really had to know that SOMEONE nearby, be it Jessica in class, my lab director at the VA, or Hadele at the dinner, knew that I was still a 'normal' person, that I was not crazy and that this was 'just for a class.' It reflected my own insecurity about being different from others. That was probably the most interesting thing I learned from doing this, because at first I didn't even realize I was following this pattern everywhere I went in my dress. I walked home with Yasamin and Amit. After I debriefed them post-dinner, Yasamin said that'several' people had approached her during the dinner and said 'Sanjida looks really nice today.' I suppose that some people may have decided that since I had 'tried' so hard to 'look nice,' the fact that I didn't match didn't matter (E for effort?), and overall, to them, I did 'look good.' However, another possible explanation is simply the social norm of polity. It is 'common knowledge' that one should not criticize someone to their face because it might hurt their feelings. That is, keep the negative opinions to yourself, and express the positive. It is probably a good thing that we do this, survival wise. I don't think everyone would want to know what I totally honestly think of them at some time or another, and I don't think I would want to know what they totally honestly think of me at some time or another. So, it makes me wonder how","to re fertilize the land, and eke out a meager existence, free from the tyranny of the nobility.          The problem is that it is impossible to tell who owns the land. The deeds are held privately, and though there is usually a historical record as to who  originally  owned the land, one can never tell who currently owns it, if anybody. There have been many such serfs who, seeking freedom, went to what seemed to be unclaimed land, created a life there, only to be persecuted by soldiers of an owner who has neglected the land. As a result, nobody finds freedom on the free lands. Only the existing nobility can afford to even attempt to work the free land, because they have money enough to exploit it.          That's the way they like it; it binds the serfs to them very effectively, and ensures that nobody will ever emerge who can compete with them in the agricultural goods market.          Such a land exists. It is called the United States of America, except instead of land, it's ideas which I am discussing. Instead of a feudal nobility, it is the existing coalition of media corporations. Instead of serfs and peasants seeking the free lands, it is creators who, much like the founders of these corporations, seek to use historical materials (like Steamboat Bill Jr. to Walt Disney) as a basis for their own cultural creations. Instead of privately held deeds, it is unregistered copyrights. Instead of the great mix of unowned and owned but unused lands, it is the great mass of images and sounds which might be used in everything from documentaries to music videos, but cannot because their copyright status cannot be determined except at great expense (or risked at even greater expense). Instead of soldiers, it is lawyers, both for destroying those who dare seek creative freedom, and determining what of the mix is part of the public domain.

Bolton, Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security, testified to back in September of 2003   We have seen Syria take a series of hostile actions toward Coalition forces in Iraq. Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so. Syria continues to provide safe haven and political cover to Hizballah in Lebanon, which has killed hundreds of Americans in the past. Statements from many of Syria’s public officials during this time vilified the Coalition’s motives in seeking to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the United States portrayed as an enemy is a consistent theme found in newspapers and public statements in Syria as it is in other states in the region. Although Damascus has increased its cooperation regarding Iraq since the fall of the Iraqi regime, its behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syria’s WMD capabilities.

Instead of going to the Civil Rights Museum on MLK, they are staying in Forsyth.  Meanwhile, on Reynolds Square, a small group of protesters are putting up signs while surrounded by National Guardsmen.    This is all called a 'nonstory.'    So, here's a lesson.

The first essay of part two was probably the best one and Tyke also read it while in Paris which made it funnier cuz the action takes place in Paris too.  But you might enjoy it so pick it up.  Tyke hasn't really read much of Deception Point, another Dan Brown book but he did read of course Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  Both were good tales.  And Tyke actually read them and did it quickly which was quite shocking to his mother.  But after the 9 hours somehow passed on the long flight, Tyke got to Vancouver, B.C. and waited around to get on his next flight to Sea-Tac.  This flight was a small plane that seated 33 people today.  It had propellers and in order to get on and off they had to walk down onto the tarmac and step directly on the plane.  It was like Tyke was either the President or a member of the Olympic team returning with a gold medal to the land of his adoring fans.  Needless to say, Tyke felt honored to be able to go through such an event.  And then they got in their 'limo' (a Town Car really) and watched as they were driven home.  Then Tyke came home, looked at messages he got (thanks for em), and then unpacked and showered.  He is ready for tomorrow to begin though.  A new day and a new life.  Summer now begins for Tyke...college is not far off though.  Folks, Tyke is just so excited to be home now.  This is great.<\s>Today Tyke actually went out and did stuff.&nbsp; He cleaned the downstairs a little bit because his parents are having a brunch in the morning on Sunday so he was forced to clean up.&nbsp; But it isn't a bad thing cuz it means that the place will look nice until the next time Tyke's friends come over and they trash the place.&nbsp; So it will probably look good for about 7 hours.&nbsp; After cleaning Tyke went over to Amed's house and he took the van cuz his car was taken to get new pretty tires.&nbsp; Now he will actually have front tires that grip.&nbsp;",".  Skippy and Mandy basically had sex and Tyke had some fun of his own with Lisa Lovey.  Tyke also made up a new game called Musical Laps.  The premise of the game is quite similar to the game Musical Chairs.  However, one sex is sitting down and acting as the chairs.  The music starts and the opposite sex walks around the circle and when the music stops the walkers have to stop and sit on the sitter's lap and then the sitter has to guess who it is.  The winners advance to the next round and the winners win.  Ask Tyke if you don't understand the game.<\s>WOW, all can be said about today is WOW.  It started off with Tyke getting up at approximately 9:23 to take a shower and make himself clean for his soccer game (paradoxical???).  But soccer was a breeze.  Pretty much a raping.  They fucked the other team.  13-1 was the final score.  Tyke had 2 goals and 2 assists and this really isn't important is it...oh well.  Well then he went to Costco with Macaroon, Tyronius, and Kinker and his parents and Tyke got a Hand Dipped Super Premium Ice Cream Bar with Almonds.  MMMMMMMM....GOOOOOOD....AHHHHH.  It was heaven-ish.  Then he went home and began down the long and winding road towards completion of the worst shaping outline that was ever forced upon a student.  It was done just 8 hours later at approximately 9:40 and that was one of the earliest times on the information super highway.  Others took quite a while to do so.  But he finished and that is all that matters.  He also went to a party for a girl and it was ok.  He lost to Skippy 105-84 in paper football but it was a great game.  Other than that he pretty much said nothing to anyone.  Ya know, his usual lonesome self.  Not that it is other people's fault for him not talking but he doesn't like having to barge in on conversations or anything like that.  He just likes to be invited or when he is really sad he likes it when someone will notice and just come up and give him a hug or come sit next to him or just smile and wink at him or something.  That makes all the difference.",blog_6611,blog_6611,True

17,"� Cloud took matters into his own hands and, with a quick apology to Tifa, drove right across the lawn, tearing up the grass as he went. As Tifa lamented the fate of their front lawn and everyone, even Elena, promised to help her replant it, Cloud half drove/half hydroplaned across the grassy fields beyond Kalm until they reached the highway leading to Midgar.   After scraping the bottom of the buggy getting onto the road itself, they were finally on their way. Cloud breathed a sigh of relief. He just hoped this trip was going to be worth all the trouble they were going through to get there. But he was in for a lot more trouble along the way…   Two minutes after they had gotten onto the highway, Reno decided that he didn’t like Cloud reaching between his legs every time he needed to change gears.   “Strife, stop doing that!”   Cloud scowled. “I need to change the gears, Reno. Unless you want to be going 15 miles per hour all the way to Midgar?”   “Well, no!” Reno said. “But why do you need to keep changing the damn gears so much? Just go to a really high speed and stay there!”   Cloud pointed to a big puddle sitting in the middle of the road. “See that there?” he asked impatiently. “If I hit that going 60 miles an hour, we’re gonna skid off the road and into the grass and then we’ll be walking all the way to Midgar!”   Reno floundered for words. “Well, um, I have an idea! I’ll change the goddamn gears from now on!”   Cloud was in no mood to argue. “Fine. I’ll tell you when to change them.”   Reno made a face and gripped the shift with one hand. “I don’t need you to tell me! I can change gears without your help. I have a standard car, too, ya know.”   Cloud had to bite his tongue to keep from yelling, but he decided to let Reno have his way if they wanted to get to Midgar within the next year. Unfortunately, their little arrangement didn’t work out very well. Reno had no idea when Cloud needed to have a","gear shifted because he insisted that he didn’t need to watch the speedometer. As a result, he kept shifting gears at the oddest times, making the buggy jerk and stall and make very ugly-sounding noises. More than once, Red ended up falling from the girls’ laps and sliding to the floor of the car. Finally, Cid threatened to skewer Reno with the Venus Gospel if he didn’t relinquish control of the shift. Noticing that the pilot was serious, Reno reluctantly surrendered control back to Cloud with the complaint that he still felt “violated” every time Cloud changed a gear.   The trip went as smoothly as possible for the next five minutes until Barret broke the tranquility.    “Okay, it smells like arse up in here! Who farted?”   “You smelt it, you dealt it!” Reno declared cheerfully.   “Maybe it’s your upper lip,” Elena snapped, using her anger to cover up the fact that sitting in Rude’s lap made her nervous as hell.   “Well, it sure as hell wasn’t me!” Cid exclaimed.   “You denied it, you supplied it!” Reno said immediately, ignoring the fierce glare Cid shot him.   “Actually, it smells more like a wet dog,” Barret corrected himself, sniffing at the air.   “That would be me,” Red said flatly. “Now hush.”    Barret hushed because he couldn’t think of a snappy comeback to say. Cloud unconsciously began to drive faster, eager to get to Midgar before they all went stir-crazy and started killing each other or something. He counted the minutes of peace and got up to ten before Tifa, of all people, spoke up.   Hers was the nice kind of interruption, though.    She smiled and said in a hushed tone, “How cute! Look! Yuffie’s asleep.”   And sure enough, Cloud turned around briefly to see that Yuffie had fallen asleep in Vincent’s lap with her head nestled fearlessly underneath the man’s chin. Her eyelids fluttered slightly as if she sensed their stares, and she cuddled closer to Vincent as if to",blog_270,blog_270,True

Dick’s was empty, had an ugly bartender, and featured maybe 3 bar patrons whose combined age was higher than their average SAT scores, for sure. So, in other words, it was just like the Dick’s back home in Austin!  Not sure what I’m going to do tonight. I am probably going to go out for a drink again and continue my exploration of the New York gay bars. This time I’ll be alone, though, since Yvette has to go to work early in the morning. We’ll see how much I’ve really aged – if I mainly feel like a hermit or a misanthrope and just sit in a corner drinking my gin, that will be pretty sad.<\s>So I spent most of the day alone. I didn’t have much of a plan, so I just got on the train and went looking for some old haunts. Went down around the Union Square area, then got back on the train and went for old Christopher Street. I’m a sucker for this kind of shit. Gay history. Buildings with new skins. Something historical turned into retail and profit. Hey – it’s great to be gay!!  Yvette and I did end up going to that series of short films. It was actually a great experience for me. They showed the in a café in Spanish Harlem. First of all, we had dinner at a place called La Fonda Boricqua (!!), which was all great and shit except for the fact that they had no menus and the first 3 things I ordered were all out. The waitress was really charming, though, in her sincere sense of apology and really strange way of communicating what might actually be available for consumption.  When we finally got to Carlito’s Café (the place hosting the film screening), we were all fucking delighted by the first short – a mock music video about the Virgen de Guadalupe and Juan Diego set to the music of J.Lo.’s “Jenny from the Block.” I’m going to say nothing more about it, because it was really too clever for my present words typed in a semi-drunken state.  After that, we came back to the apartment and chilled for awhile. Then around 11;45 or so, we finally motivated to go to some","mood to talk back.  Second period.  Hitler.  Oh shit, if he weren't dead I'd've killed him.  And anyone who thinks they know everything about WWII, because you don't look smart, you're a fucking pain the ass.  Third period.  Was fun.

O_O  Albeit an *illegal* copy of Photoshop with no brushes.. but.. Photoshop.. [licks lips]  Okay, my day is a little bit better.  Fourth period.  Was STUPID.  God, and I thought Charmaine couldn't serve.  She can't hit the ball, either, so we only won once, and that was because Tiffany can't serve either.  Fifth period.  Is Latin ever fun?  Tell me the truth.  Ryan was depressed as hell, and I swear the poor baby had a headache coupled with severe male PMS.  And Kline was as super-happy as ever, which pissed the shit out of everyone in the back row... no, wait, just me and Ryan.  Sixth period.  Biology.  We started talking about evolution, then Hall started going on about a *higher power.*  Fuck, it was like Mears revisited: 'Whenever I see a TREE, I can't help but think there's someone OUT THERE controlling things!'  Bullshit.  Full-fledged atheism right now.  I'm listening to music and if the Weiss boys mention 'kami' I will fucking blow my top.  Takehito Koyasu is my hero even though he seems pretty Christian.  >.>  And if I read somewhere that he *is* Christian... then... I'll follow in my own fucking footsteps.  So I run out of bio to escape Caitlin (sorry, but if you talked to me I would've punched you in the face) and then I had to face super genki mother, which pissed me off greatly.  And so I got home, wasted an hour of my life on geometry and Latin homework, then went upstairs to my COMPUTER.  Which, once I turned on, gave me a fucking error message.

The Baby  By your 8th week of pregnancy, the crown-to-rump length of your baby is 0.56 to 0.8 inch (14 to 20 mm).  This is about the size of a pinto bean.  Your baby is continuing to grow and to change rapidly during these early weeks.  Eyelid folds are forming on the face.  The tip of the nose is present.  Ears are forming, internally and externally.  In the heart, the aortic and pulmonary valves are present and distinct.  Tubes leading from the throat to the functioning part of the lungs are branched, like the branches of a tree.  The body's trunk area is getting longer and straightening out.  Elbows are present, and the arms and leggs extend forward.  Arms have grown longer.  They bend at the elbows and curve slightly over the heart.  The digital rays, which become fingers, are notched.  Toe rays are present on the feet.  Your embryo is about 8mm long, and an ultrasound done now would detect the tiny thumping of the heart. Although all her major organs have formed, they are not fully developed or functional.  Your baby is constantly moving and shifting, although you won't be able to feel it for many more weeks.

Several months ago I marked my calendar with the arrival date of 'The Stone Reader;' it was worth the wait.  I don't see enough movies to properly review one, but I will share a few thoughts.  In 1972 Mark Moskowitz bought a book called  urlLink The Stones of Summer  because of a rave review in the NY Times that called it something like the voice of a new generation.  He couldn't get into it then, so he put it away and came across it a few years ago.  He read it, and fell in love with it.  Now this is not a book that I would probably read, but any bibliophile/bookbitch can certainly identify with the idea of falling in love with a book, of wanting to read all the author's books.  But when Moskowitz went looking for more books by Dow Mossman, he hit a different kind of stone; a stone wall.  He couldn't find a thing and not only that, he discovered that this book which he thought brilliant, was out of print.  Moskowitz has a film production company that does political commercials and he decided to film his journey to find out what happened to Mossman.  To be perfectly honest, there were slightly less than a dozen people in the theater during the showing I saw, and at one point I was the only one awake.  There are probably too many artsy-fartsy shots of butterflies and moons, although I did love the shots of forsythia, a bush I have missed for my many years of Florida living.  Yet the DVD comes out in November, and I find myself longing to order it online from The Stone Reader website because it comes not only with the obligatory additional footage but an entire third disk that won't be available for purchase elsewhere - 4 more hours of a 2 hour movie that put a lot of people to sleep.

The newspaper quoted Bakhtiar Amin, the human rights minister in the new Iraqi government, who said he had visited Saddam’s cell on Saturday. Amin said he did not speak to the former Iraqi leader.  Bakhtiar said Saddam appeared “in good health and being kept in good conditions,” but he “appeared demoralized and dejected,” The Guardian reported. Saddam’s air-conditioned cell in a U.S. military prison is 10 feet wide and 13 feet long, Amin said. Saddam is not allowed to mix with other prisoners.    Saddam likes American muffins, cookies.   Amin had little to report on Saddam’s poetry. “One of the poems is about George Bush, but I had no time to read it,” Amin said.  He reported that Saddam was being treated for high blood pressure and a chronic prostate infection, and was gaining weight after losing 11 pounds during a time when he resisted all fatty foods.  Saddam and other detainees get an MRE (meal ready to eat) breakfast, and hot food twice a day, Amin said. Dessert might include oranges, apples, pears or plums, but   Saddam also likes American muffins and cookies , The Guardian quoted Amin as saying.

Mr. Azgez went home carrying two first position trophies from his first symposium, which I consider to be quite commendable.   --Karan Misra President, Exun  We take printouts<\s>Arrive at Mata Jai Kaur Public School: drum-guy of the marching band wearing the exact same sash as our head boys and head girls - totally ditto, same  chatai  material, colour, knot and everything. This school calls its computer competition Cyberfest (as you would probably have noticed), but wait, its computer club is called WHIZKIDZ. Next, they don't even have an auditorium; we were seated in a  Pandaal, which would be more suited to a  langar  than a computer competition. The chief guest looked like he was the school's peon, with his  chaprasi  clothes and simply horrid grammar. We did ourselves the courtesy of not listening to him, and instead munching on our lunch boxes (in my case, of course, munching on  other  peoples' tiffins).   The first event was Senior Quiz Preliminary Round. I was quite pissed off because it started an hour late, and Bhavya was even more pissed off, because after seeing the question paper, he realised that it was all technical. I managed to get sixteen out of twenty questions  pucca  right, guessed on three and left one.  Result : We got the   first position   in the written preliminaries.  The second event was Linux Programming. I've always thought of myself as a seriously pathetic programmer at computer symposia, who couldn't program even to save his life. That changed today. It was Linux programming of course, which means that there's less of logic and more of 'knowledge'. You have to 'know' the arcane commands in Linux. For example, in normal computer languages like C++ and BASIC, 'if' statements are either if...else, if..then..else, or if...then...else...end if, but in Linux, it's if...then...elif...fi. Sorry to geek you people out, but it simply looks stupid. Here's where we prospered. You see, Mr. Azgez (Exun Programmer 2004-05) agreed to learn these arcane commands and","be out here.

Why do you think they are fighting Bush’s nominations so much.  Typically, FDR plays a more prominent role for the leftist political groups vs. the, say, tree huggers of the left, but be rest assured he is the foundation for the left’s belief system.  “My viewpoint is right”  I get so enraged when I have a discussion with a leftist.  It is expected that if they make a good point that I concede the point, but if I show that they are wrong, I’m an asshole.

We started the more technical parts of Telecom now.. with complex Physics terminologies and such. It was okay, just need some reading up. We're far behind the schedule, cuz usually when we discuss about something, other things pop up! Ev3r so often, we're distracted from the original thing. I think we were talking about Radio waves & Communications. Then, he said something about Astro. We all know that Astro is satellite, and that's another topic.  So, Jason actually worked for Astro for a period of time. He brought up the issue of hacked Astro cards and said that Astro actually knew those who are stealing their services. A mate of mine said that his whole neighbourhood are using hacked cards. I mean, pay a one time fee, and you're FREE from pesky subscription charges. It costs about Rm 130 a month for all packages here in Malaysia, so, in a year, its about Rm 1500 in fees. Then, he talked about spot beams... that Astro has a big 'footprint', yes.. basically, if you're in China, India or Philippines, or even West Australia, you can get Astro reception. However, a concentrated 'beam' is sent to an area (for example, Kampong Beribi in Brunei).. then, the computer calculates how many signals'reflect'. Its sort of like a 'ping' and then, they check with their subsciption records for people who paid. If they get more 'pings', that means someone's not paying.  Actually, its kinda foolish for people not wanting to pay AT ALL. It'll be too obvious dammit! I wonder what guts it took you to go to the Astro office and say, 'I don't want your service anymore'.

A horse and wagon finally drew alongside him on the road, and the driver invited the man to climb aboard. After getting on the wagon, he sat down but continued to hold the heavy bag.        When the driver suggested that the man set the bag down in the wagon, he replied, 'I don't want to trouble you too much, sir. You are giving me the ride already, so I'll just carry the potatoes.'       'How foolish of him!' we say. Yet sometimes we do the same thing when we attempt to bear the burdens of our lives in our own strength. No wonder we become weary and overwhelmed with anxiety and fear.       In Psalm 55, David spoke of anxiety he felt because his enemies were attacking him (vv. 1-15). But then he gave his concerns to the Lord and was filled with renewed hope and confidence (vv.16-23). That's why he could write, 'Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you' (v. 22)       When we recall the story of the man and his bag of potatoes, remember the simple lesson it illustrates: Rather than trying to bear your burdens by yourself, set them down in God's hands.       Give Him each perplexing problem, All your needs to Him make known;     Bring to Him your daily burdens - Never carry them alone!

None took it on, so she sent it to Tindall Street, a publisher in Birmingham, who brought the book into the world.   DBC Pierre, who also appears on the long list, thinks this is because the agents don't look at much in their slush piles, and leave the skimming to interns. Some of the agents who turned down his book, Vernon God Little, don't even appear to know that they had done so. 'I've since heard that some of the people I sent it to said they'd have loved to have seen it.'   Yann Martel, who won the prize last year, was turned down by five publishers before Canongate accepted The Life of Pi. Francis Bickmore found it in the in-tray, and suspects that the publishers who rejected it didn't give themselves a chance to read it. The whole business is a raffle.   When there are so many blows to an author's confidence, it's hard to see how anyone can carry on writing. I suspect that those who do come to see rejection letters as scars that hurt for a while but soon become things you can show off. Jack London used to frame his.

In this age of Oprah Winfrey, in which we all have something to say and, by God, we're going to say it, we are becoming increasingly familiar with the genre of the rejection letter. Don't worry if your work is turned down, we are told on myriad error-filled websites: so was Margaret Mitchell's, plenty of times, and JK Rowling's too. The premise here is that writers are beautiful individuals, and that publishers are corporate idiots.   And if aspiring writers still doubt that they're special, they can reflect that Paine, Poe and Pope published themselves, as if the work of these plucky pamphleteers and poets had spent years in a vault at HarperCollins but, hurray, they had enough self-belief to get out there and make us listen.  Just this month, the example of the Rev GP Taylor provides a fillip to all those who feel undervalued or overlooked: an editor took issue with his use of the word'skulduggery' in the manuscript of his novel","a new speed modelling topic at CGTalk  *sigh* Not a new subject...

Moulin Rouge  is a period piece that uses contemporary details to evoke what the past might have actually felt like. it centers around the abstract concept of Love. ultimately, it has very little subtext or underlying statement about the real world -- it's just a fanciful tale about early 20th century paris.

If you can't do it now, you never will. Very stressful. When you're a kid, it may feel like everything is the end of the world, but you really have so much time.

I almost never go to big museums anymore. I'm just not interested anymore. Have my interests evolved or have museums gotten more boring? I don't feel that I HAVE to take an interest in the big shows, but does that just put me at risk of becoming someone who complains about what they don't really take the effort to experience? Like the person who refuses to vote and believes that they are making some kind of statement on futility or something. When I hear about someone bitching about the blockbuster shows because they feel that  they are either too distant from the public or too pop culture, it just doesn't make much sense. You can't have it both ways. Or maybe you can. The people that I have been reading lately that are making the most sense are the ones who just want to tear it down and create something new. I believe that the 'big' museum does serve an educational and a cultural purpose. The problem is that they have become the only way in which people are allowed to view art. I understand the frustration of that for an artist. How can they do anything if the only way for them to get their work shown is to do something like what others are doing so they too can be included in the 'canon'.

So was Sun. Those girls are crazy. Very young. The space the party was in was really great. I heard that it is a sort of co-op gallery/live/work thing.

The other band was OK. The film thing was amazing though. It was at the RedCat. They are called Animal Charm. They take old corporate, industrial, self-help type videos and films and mix them up, adding new sound. Really hilarious. Franklin said they do a music performance thing too under a different name.

I went to preschool there, and even though the community playground was in  my  backyard (I thought that was the absolute coolest thing in the world.. my back yard was a  huge  playground, with swings, teeter-totters, a merry-go-round, those odd horse-things mounted on giant coil springs... you name it, we had it, all in a giant sandbox), but even though I had such a huge kid-magnet, the lack of children my age meant I played out there alone.  Apparently mom didn't have any friends with kids.  Preschool was one thing, but that was only an hour or two a day.  I did spend about a week in daycare; I think my mom did that to try and socialize me a bit more, but the ladies that ran the daycare were horrible.  They sat me in the corner once because I didn't like peas, and wouldn't eat the ones they fed to us.  They had a bunch of the red cardboard bricks you could use to build simple stuff with, and that was probably my favourite toy there, but the other kids got preferential treatment, and whenever I wanted to build something other than what they wanted to build,  I  was the one scolded and told to share.  I complained to mom until she pulled me out of it, but she never really believed my stories of how horrible the place was.  When I was about five and a half, dad got out of submarine duty, and spent the next three years as a recruiter, which required a move to Georgia.  They found a house in Leesburg, Georgia, which was an hour's drive from Americus, Georgia, where my dad worked.  As such, dad was very much gone when I woke up in the mornings, and usually wouldn't get home until somewhere between 6 and 7:30, leaving no more than two hours of time with me before I had to go to bed, even though in those days I would lie in bed for four or five hours before falling asleep.

Shoot the shit. Talk about old times. D:  long pause > HAHHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHHAHHAHHA .  After a round of similar calls, Vijay mentioned that he wanted to have dinner with another friend of his named David. This was the second time I wanted to kick him into traffic. David is a short, fat, red-headed computer programmer. He's half Iranian and quite possibly the most annoying person in the 510 are code. He has more hair on his back than on any other part of his body--COMBINED--and has made it clear to everyone he knows that he prefers anal sex to any other sort of sexual contact.  The prospect of dinner with Vijay and David should have had me fleeing the scene like a parole violator in a COPS episode. Instead I said sure and headed with Vijay--WHO STILL HADN'T SHUT THE FUCK UP--to an Indian restaurant. Dinner lasted an unmerciful 90 minutes with Vijay and David volleying computer-programming anecdotes back and forth in an attempt to one-up each other as to who has a tougher job and lives a more stultifyingly boring existence.  They tossed around words like 'firewall' and 'DLL' and 'database management' and'sysadmin' with nerdful giddiness. At one point David actually spit a mouthful of tika masala halfway across the table in a fit of laughter after Vijay told him about somebody at his office patching the wrong something or other during a'standard fix' and then running something or other and bringing the whole system down. As they knowingly laughed the laugh of computer nerds, I seriously contemplated stabbing myself in the leg repeatedly with my curry-stained fork just to prove to myself that I was, in fact, still alive.  After the computer talk stopped, Vijay started holding forth on what it takes to be'successful in the real world.' What it takes to 'prove to everyone that you can do the 9-5 thing.' How he has devised a plan to go to grad school, 'be an entrepenuer by the age of 30' because he 'can't work like this for much longer.'

It must have been uneventful, as I don’t even remember the movie that ended my solo movie going virginity.  Now, I don’t even think twice about it and yet I think I’m still a bit of a rebel in the venture.  I don’t think my friends do this.  I even have a friend who doesn’t like to rent movies alone. Movie watching is a solitary act anyway, unless, of course, you are at home snuggled up on a couch.  So, if a movie is out that I want to see and no one else does, or I’m near a movie theatre and see something interesting, or I’m bored at home and need to do something other than stare at myself, I’ll go to a movie, alone.  No big deal, it just happens.  So, last night was “Raising Helen.”    Sad bit of a movie if you ask me.  The plot was weak and lame and not well thought out.  There were scenes were I literally wanted to rewind and rewrite and then there were the ever present continuity issues where the clothes in one scene are the same in the next scene although it’s a different day.  This movie overall has bad writing, bad editing, and not really great acting although I still adore Kate Hudson, John Corbett, and Joan Cusak.  What were they thinking?  Anyway, good premise, just not well done.  And, I’m beginning to rethink things about my friends who said it was “so cute.”     And then, because I could, I went Wal-marting at midnight.  I stepped into the Wal-mart at 12:15am and spent the next 45 minutes shopping the supper center.  It was fabulous and surreal.   Tons of people were about, mostly Wal-mart workers restocking the shelves and a few customers.  There were boxes everywhere, which you had to navigate around.   The restockers would sometimes give me weird glances like it was crazy that I was bargain shopping in the middle of the night on a Thursday.  Please, like it’s not weird that you are working at Wal-mart in the middle of the night.  Yarn was had because well, the kitting has not stopped.  And then,",blog_17349,blog_14,False

Why isn't it a known fact that you start a few beats later, so that 'Lord we lift your name on high' becomes 'lift your name on high'.

42,"ings  Well Ms Wisking. Since you have decided to fight fire with your soggy wit, I have decided to take the preverbial gloves off.  SInce you have decided (in your narrowminded little way) to play to the stereotyping of Pink, I think you should stop wearing colours that are so obviously'masculine'. No longer shall you wear 'blue' jeans, as blue is the colour of little boys. If you are going to stereotype Pink, well then you must mean to stereotype all colours. And if you are going to attempt to defend that one, then just try. If pink has classically been known as a 'feminine' colour, well then it is doubly true that 'blue' has long since been considered'masculine'. You must be attempting to eminate the male species Ms Wisking, if you wear blue. Since I for one, do NOT agree with your Gender stereotyping of colours, I am fortunately free to wear whatever I want, ignoring the malicious comments from those of your 'kind'.       I would like to take this moment to explain to you, what marriage is all about. My Father (Bill) and my mother (Jan) agree on COMPROMISES in their marriage. For example, Jan wants to decorate the Master Bedroom in Dusty Rose and Mauve colours, while Bill wants a 37 inch TV and entertainment unit, they both agree to get what they want, they COMPROMISE! I guess my Father just wants my mother to be happy, and considers a 'Pink' room, (which no one sees except for family and friends, who decide to use it aginst him) a small price to pay, to have the leather couches, and 37 inch TV that he wants in the living room. We know who runs the roost in your house. If you can't even add water to the mushrooms while cooking dinner, in fear of setting off LINDA!, Well then, she must weild some power! And who are you to make fun of my Dad living in a 'Pink' room, when your Dad's video colection includes 'DOWN TO YOU' with Freddy Prince Junior!!!!! Take a good hard Look MS WISKING.

Still does not explain why I cannot count stitches and keep track of things properly. I went to the bottom, and by inserting a yarn marker every 25 stitches, I counted. The cast on turns out to be fine. I did the same just below the point where I began the underarm bind off's and it was the same count. Good. Embarrassing, but good. LOL!

I saw her in the mall and said hi but she didn't see me, but I guess she saw me then! Her and Dean where there. Now Dean hasn't really ever talked to me unless Alison is there, which obviously she never now cause she moved, which is sad cause Dean is a nice kid. Well...that I know of.

The conference started on Friday night, and Denise took our four children to meet me at St.&nbsp;Thomas University (the conference's location) after work.  As Denise was getting the children out of the car, another car pulled up to hers and a family composed two adults and one small child stepped out.   The mother looked at our van-load of four children and started to remark how amazing it was that we had such a large family.  She repeatedly complimented Denise at her ability to handle so many children.  She said several times that she had no idea how Denise could keep up with them.  She said she could hardly handle the one little boy they had.  She even gave our oldest soon (who was on the threshold of turning three years old) a tennis ball.   She was very kind, and I very much appreciate the fact that she was trying to be encouraging.  But it saddens me that a family with four children should inspire such awe.  Yes, they're a handful, but children are also an amazing  gift.  We don't stand in awe of people who work weekends and evenings to get a promotion or raise.  We recognize that they are making an investment in what they believe to be important.

Paraphrased, she said something along the lines of, 'Beauty never did anything for me. It didn't spare me pain or hardship and I still have to work for everything I get. And since it doesn't last, I don't rely on it.' I thought that was pretty wise, and taken from a true BP, we should all listen up. She's known as one of the most beautiful people in America, yet as far as life goes, her life has been hardly different from the average woman. She has still had the pain of two divorces, she hasn't found someone with which she can trust to have children with, she still has to work hard to keep the momentum of her career going, and right now, she's alone. I'm not a BP, and I don't even have half those troubles. Who needs it? Life is hard enough for the average ugly person, but contrary to what I used to believe, it can probaby be harder for a BP.  So here we are, people like me, the fattys of the world. Though we typically have genuine friendships, spouses who love us and nice careers, we look at the BPs in the magazines and billboards and visualize ourselves looking like them. But why? I think that generally we set ourselves up to think that when we are that thin, we can do  anything.  We can run on private beaches with a hunk of guy, falling into the surf and kissing him, or we can not only be thin, but also have the perfect makeup, skin, teeth, hair and nose. And strangers on the street will want to take pictures of us or hang out with us or just admire us for our wonderful thin-ness.  What?  There's one thing I realized when I lost 55 lbs. 2 years ago. I kept getting thinner, but  nothing else was changing.  Somehow I had imagined myself with a great body and hair and makeup, when in reality I was just getting thinner. I still had a scar on my forehead, a pockmark on my nose, big feet and leg hair. I kept looking in the mirror and seeing the same person. In fact, the only way I noticed I was losing the weight was I kept putting on pants that there's no way I could fit my big behind into and they would be loose on me. Why?

You find the marks where to put your eyes, mouth, nose, ears, ect. I was made to do one. As i did mine i was thinking 'wow this looks pretty good...' haha It was actually a lovely picture, seeing the source haha i cant draw. I laid down my pencil and crayons and looked at my masterpiece but only to see how depressed it looked. It really got to me. I swear if i was in my room drawing that i would have started crying. It looked so damn depressd! 'I' wasnt even smiling! Well, because i couldnt master the smiling lips very well..haha i told my mom 'I' looked depressed so she put some lines under my eyes to 'change the expression' whatever, i still looked at'me' and saw a depressed face. Then again, i am leaving all summer and i'm going to be without my friends...maybe i am somewhat distressed. not depressed...but i dont know..saddened maybe. Oh and i almost hit the mailman when i was driving...haha   It's a beautiful day!!! People are going to grad. tomorrow night and then to see the movie The Day After Tomorrow. Part of me wants to go since i will be leaving saturday, but then part of me doesnt. I dont know why i dont want to go...i mean, come on now julia, you'll be leaving and now heres a chance to go see a movie you WANT to see and CANT wait to see with your FRIENDS...i dont know how to explain that one. Maybe i dont want to go to grad. Part of me does...but the other part doesnt really wanna sit there and watch people go away. Maybe im just being a stupid bitch stick in the mud. haha I'll prob go anyways...make myself go, knowing i'll regret it if i dont...but i'll have to totally haul ass to pack and clean my room, because if my room isnt clean by the time i leave my mom is going to clean it. That means she'll read every note and evey paper under my bed. I dont know if i really want that. haha no telling what i've hidden in my room i have forgotten about...

I told him i was anti-killing-mice. he laughed. what a dip shit! haha ANYWAYS, we got everything filed and all that good stuff and well...my dog is gone, but at least shes not out alone in this world being kicked around..she's warm and taken care of. I hope we get her back, but i highly doubt it. stupid fucker mike. I hope he rots in hell. WELL, while all this is going on with molly missing and us noticing, my dad calls. He wanted to talk to mom about visiting, mom was too upset, so i had to explain to my dad why she was upset and that her and mike were no longer together. he found out only last week in an email. Mom and john drove around the neighborhood looking for molly while i sat on the couch with roberta eating chocolate ice cream, i know that sounds pretty damn sorry but i was upset and i knew my mom needed space. Im not going to mention this to any of my friends, about molly and all.

I'm glad hes gone..im really honestly glad. fuck him. all those years i needed that father figure and he wasnt it, he told me he loved me once and thats the first time i saw him after he married my mom. I didnt love him, but its good to hear someone loves u, especially ur dad and at the time hes all i had on a day to day basis. fuck him.

54,"many of our young people drifting away to other traditions that offer a more solid understanding of its beliefs and practices (e.g. Roman Catholicism or Buddhism) or to rejecting organized religion altogether (ironically enough given that many of their parents came to Quakerism due to their rejection of organized religion). New comers, on the other hand, mistakenly translate the fact that Quakers don’t have creeds to mean that we don’t have any doctrines or beliefs (other than the overly used “that of God in everyone” and the even less specific “the Light”). Thus, they spend their time amongst Friends discovering and creating their own belief systems (if any at all) and, if they choose to join, wind up expecting (sometime demanding) that the Religious Society of Friends shift and change to accommodate their unique, idiosyncratic belief system.  But, what to do? Where do we “draw the line”? These are difficult questions since Friends have a history of being so rigid and doctrinaire that for a period of time they “disowned” (read: excommunicated) thousands of its members.   Have we gone too far the other way? The struggle is to find a way that it neither too unbending nor too yielding (for the sake of individualism and diversity). At a minimum Meetings and organizations need to become reengaged with Friends’ past through ongoing Quaker 101 studies for newcomers, Bible and Faith & Practice studies, and children and youth programs that specifically teach the very same things in a way that younger folks can appreciate.

55,"the respective band sites. This helped the mood somewhat, as did the back cover Underground Inc ad that had Chemlab on it.  Also, arriving on my door that day was the debut album from the french band COLDER, who Irene suggested to me after reading that they were compared to a pop Joy Division and Suicide. Well, that merited a looksee. I'm happy to report the album, AGAIN, is very enjoyable. It's not so much songs as it is moods. The man behind colder is a French-Asian dude who is also a multimedia artist, and Colder is both a film and music project. The package I got had a CD with music and then the accompanying DVD of short films to go with the music. I think the only reason it's musically compared to Joy Divsion is that some of the drum programming is very Stephen Morris like. Plus the artwork is very JD. Cool stuff.  With Irene out running yesterday morning, I popped in my long-awaited copy of the Thai movie ONG BAK, which has been making waves in the Martial Arts Movie circles for some time for it's frighteningly real use of Thai boxing moves in a Martial Arts Movie setting. The star, who is also the co-writer of the film, Phanom Yeerum had been described to me as someone who could fight like Bruce Lee and fly like Jackie Chan. Now, you know I don't accept shit like that lightly, so I went out of my way to check this movie out. Needless to say, the movie itself is totally underwhelming and cliche, but the fighting is the scariest I have ever seen on film. Ever. Thai boxing is an exceptionally brutal sport and this film captures that brutality in a way that makes you scream with delight while also cringing for the life of Phanom Yeerum as well as his poor stuntmen. It was scary good. The DVD bonus of watching them put these fights together is even scarier and better than the fights in the movie!! And yes he can flip and fly like Jackie and fight like Bruce, though he lacks the charisma of both. However, this dude is probably in a shit mood after being kicked in the head so many times. He's basically the ECW version of Kung Fu.  To me, the key will be to bring Phanom Yeerum to Hong Kong and put in a movie where an experience director and fight chroegographer can maximize that potential in a","and my long lost piano that I thought I had done in the song EXIST. I had been ranting and raving for the first month of this album that I had done piano somewhere and it was lost. Needless to say, it was nice to be justified that I am not crazy and we now have our eighth song for HF2.  We re-recorded some of the bass that I wasn’t 100% on and then I threw down some sci-fi strings that Ash will hate. Brandt played some sweet guitars, and I tried to steer him toward a “less is more” approach to this song. the results were akin to David Gilmour meeting Richard Ashcroft. Atmosphere is the name of the game for this tune, which now has the working title of SOLAR.  We’re back in the studio tonight, hopefully joined by ash and possibly Young Oscar Hess aka The Kidd. He’ll be the first person outside of the core four to hear the work in progress. As evidenced by his work on FLOOD and THE DISTRACTED LOVER, the Kidd is the person you want to have come in and give you a fresh perspective  on the material. Besides being my alleged younger sibiling, he is the only man I know besides me who has seen Marisa Tomei’s boobs in person. It’s a unique bond to share. I hope he makes it.  Had a long catch up session with original MOG member and former aggressioner Chris Link, who is impressed I have several of his F-11 songs in my Ipod. Link is a talented musician who I learned tons from in my formative years. Also, he got me into stuff like John Cale, Lou Reed and other cool stuff when we were young at NYU and I am forever in his debt (though I got him into Nick Cave!).

57,"ever worn from a boy was the amolite ring and earrings B gave me for my birthday a couple of years ago.  But otherwise, I don't wear any.  It's just a coincidence really.  But when Ani asked what I would do with jewellery from him, I told him I'd refuse it.  That absolutely flabbergasted him.    'What???  You wouldn't keep it?  Why not?' Because if you know me well enough to be giving me gifts, you'd know what to give me.  And you'd know that it's not jewellery.  A real gift of affection should be just as much proof of how much he cares as well as how much he knows about me.  Money doesn't do anything for me.  He doesn't get it.  I kind of like being so unlike anybody he already knows.  I don't think he's ever dated a little skater-girl like myself.  Although, I think the term he used to describe me was GAP-skater.  I didn't appreciate it.  I've spent a lot of years  ignoring  the GAP, and I'll not have all that boycotting done for nothing.  I don't think he's ever gotten together with a girl who played so hard to get.  Even now, getting together for 'dates' is a tricky task.  He's starting to understand that this has a lot more to do with the schedule I already had in place pre-Ani, and less to do with playing games.  I still have my wall up.  He's still hard-pressed to get little gems of Mag-isms.  And of course, there's also his testiment to never dating a girl he was already friends with.  That probably has a lot do with the way things have worked between us.  It feels to me, that he feels very comfortable with me.  There's almost no subject too taboo to discuss, we can get naked, stinky, even go to the bathroom, and nothing seems to unnerve him.  It unnerves me a little!  He's opened up to me, told me some pretty secret-sounding stuff.  I'm not sure what to do with it all.  Sometimes I think he trusts me a little too much, and I can also sense a subtext of dependency there: he really  needs  someone to open up to.

One reason why such an answer can only be woefully inadequate is that ‘goodness’ can be, and indeed is interpreted in many different ways by different people. We fully accept the inevitability of this diversity of perception and interpretation. We also understand that many acts intended to create, maintain, and spread goodness may result in ‘harm’, or downright ‘evil’. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that there are forms of evil that all laruunis should fight against, and that there must be  a huge overlap between the sets of good causes and deeds that we each define for ourselves (so that we can focus on what we do share, rather than where we disagree).  Whether or not believers in other religions take ours as a religion, they must understand a few things that are unique about us.  1.We accept no authority, no doctrine, and no dogma that goes against (direct or indirect) human interests. We do not believe that the commandments of a Creator can justify us to do irreparable harm to innocent human beings (or to unreasonably overpunish guilty human beings). We acknowledge the inevitability of conflict between human interests, and even between human beings and other species. Until species from other planets, or Oo present themselves, we refuse to justify or prohibit any human activity based on the presumed wishes of Oo, other deities, or other entities that are believed to rank higher than humans. Some may say to us, for instance, that we have a communal obligation to please God/the gods, and that the obedient believers and/or ‘the innocents’, as well as we, can be the victims of God’s/the gods’ wrath. While we cannot prove that such an indiscriminate vengeful ‘divine’ act is impossible, we refuse to forfeit our independence as moral agents to the multitude of faiths that portray different gods with different tastes, personalities, and record of wrathful acts.  2.We are fallibilistic. We understand that well-intentioned people (as well as ill-intentioned people) can make mistakes. (I myself am a fallible person who makes mistakes almost every day; and I have changed my mind about many important things, even after I became an agnostic.) Instead of denying our ignorance and weaknesses, we try to define limits to the ‘",blog_16587,blog_18154,False

But more seriously, there's the latest Ipsos-Reid poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail showing the Liberals ahead by six points.  urlLink Soblo  says this puts the Liberals and new-fangled Tories essentially back where they started a few weeks ago.  So what's with the seats? The National Post and Montreal Gazette, sister papers, say 126 Conservative seats, 95 Liberals, 60 for the Bloc and 27 NDP. The Globe and Mail extrapolates based on its new poll: 110 seats each for L and C.  The papers report most of the country has decided, except for Ontarians, which is interesting; maybe they're trying to decide just how angry they are at the Liberals, and just how concerned they might be about a Harper government.  Last month, I said I wasn't going to concentrate too much on polls. But frankly, in a race this close and this uncertain, the polls can provide good snapshots of how people are agonizing over choices. If predictions come true, there will be a low turnout, and that only increases uncertainty. And there are 5 more days of politicking before Monday's elections. That's plenty of time for another stupid Conservative move - child porn, for instance - or another Liberal gaffe.  We will see. I don't want Harper, or his hardened helmet of hair, running the show.

But, I've never been a big fan of Peter Mansbridge on The National. I've taken to TiVoing the show and skipping through his parts.  I thought I would hate the whole Election Bus thing that CBC and the other networks are using to promote themselves. And I do.

But just like rules, plans are made to be broken.   And we learn so much if we recognize those moments when we need to break them. I learned some really wonderful things about the most important person in my life because instead of setting aside a thought, I decided to act upon it. And lest I feel too good about it, I need to remember all the other times in my life when words remained unspoken and actions remained undone.  Life is too short for this. Speak. Act.  Live.

He responded right away, apologizing, saying that the b&w proofs are done, but the color lab didn't give him prints up to his standards, so they're redoing htem, and they should be done early next week.

That said, at the cliffhanger conclusion of Volume 1 what I wanted for Volume 2 was not non-stop action, I wanted talking.  I didn't have any desire to see the Bride storm through dojos for another 2 hours.  Yeah, some swordplay was going to be necessary, but I understood the world the characters lived in and wanted to, obviously, the plot to reach a full-fledged fruition but also to be given a deeper look into the mythology of the characters.  And it's what we get.  What seems clear to me is that Tarrantino is one of the best character developers in cinema.   Kill Bill  (and arguably the entire filmography) is a handful of interesting characters tossed together in a basic framework.  They invent their own story and Quentin just tweaks the knobs and dials...  'What happens if we have Uma Thurman, Darryl Hannah, and David Carradine all get their training from the same guy?'  'Let's set it so that David and Uma and Michael Madesn have the same one-of-a-kind sword.'  Most of the intricacy of the character's relationships to one another stays in the subtext but feels nevertheless more true because of it.  The story is controlled by the characters, and as such allows the actors to dazzle.  So, how Tarrantino approaches some scenes is, in some sense, dependent upon how the actors control their characters.  In other cases, Tarrantino adjusts the controls... camera angles, lighting / color design, exposure, whatever...  and the characters play through.  There's a symbiosis to the whole thing.  A few years ago, I winced at the idea of Tarrantino doing a  Dirty Dozen  style World War II flick; I couldn't see him being able to make the transition from Resevoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction into that...  But, here in  Kill Bill, he  proves  his proficiency at character design and his intent to let that design drive the story.     urlLink Full Post and Comments<\s>iRecycle   If you've got free iTunes songs from Pepsi's big promotion and have no real interest in using them (I'm in the boat, where unless I have a full cd, I have no interest in having",blog_1376,blog_11325,False

The newspaper reports there have been an endless string of documentaries on German television about the Allied bombing campaigns of the war... and books about the bombing of Dresden and other related subjects.  In an interesting way, this remembrance of the horror of war is at least part of the reason behind the German opposition to war in Iraq.  For decades, Germans have been largely prevented from talking about their own suffering during World War Two. Let's consider a few facts: the allies dumped 80 million bombs on Germany during the war. In the firebombing of Dresden on February 13, 1945... about 35,000 people died. On March 12, 1945, the American Eighth Air Force attacked Swinemunde. The city was packed with refugees fleeing the Soviets. The American attack resulted in the loss of 23,000 lives.  Right wing Germans have talked about their suffering for a long time. The difference now is that leftist writers are also writing about it. One writer has used words like 'death by gassing' and 'crematoria' to describe the effects of the firebombing on civilians-- words that would normally be reserved for the Holocaust.  I think this story is sadly illustrative of the complexity of history and the destructive nature of war.  I don't think any of us will consider massacres along the lines of the incidents I just described on the same level as genocide. The systematic destruction of the Jews in German concentration camps was and remains truly horrifying. Historical evidence has shown that Hitler carried out his plan to annihilate the Jews in an environment where thousands, maybe millions of Germans, were aware of it. Those same histories show us that ordinary people did little or nothing to stop it. It's for this reason that the culpability for the deaths of six million Jews in the Holocaust is shared by Hitler and the German people. This is true.  There's another thing that many historians tell us. Those bombing campaigns in Germany were part of a clear military strategy to demoralize the German people na dmake it possible for Allied troops to enter the country with minimal resistance. I can also accept this as true.  But history is a web of complexity-- complexity within complexity. So neither",blog_18123,blog_18123,True

I think when I return to the states I would be very interested in looking in to the schools you have mentioned, what kind of schools are they? Darjeeling has particular appeal, because I know someone there and it is in the mountains. I am also thinking I may look in to a school in Chittagong that my friend mom started. How does housing and visas go? Is there pay or do I have to pay my loan off before I go? Who do I contact and how? Any information would be great and I'll start looking in to it when I get home.

The whole thing started with an inside joke between Shiva and I on msn.   Your lord and master, Jopet.<\s>It has come to my and Maya's attention, helped by a certain post on joelle's blog, that certain members of the group are feeling somewhat detached from certain group activities. Certainly this comes as a certain worry to certain group members involved. (No more certains... I promise).  Agreeingly, Maya, Simona, Jeremy and I *have* been going out on a more frequent basis, of late, however, I completely disregard the belief, for me and Maya anyway, that we are intentionally 'barring' Shiva, Joelle and Danyel 'off'. I think it is that Maya, Simona and I are better (or actual) friends with Jeremy which means a car, which means more places available to go and more implusive 'outings'. For example, the other night at the doof, we left because, yes Jeremy *was* tired, and drivers' decisions are to be held in up most regard, however upon the change in scenery, Jeremy was able to regain a healthy mental capacity....ie not tired....(with the aid of a crappy driver reviver coffee) and we impulsively just went out again.....spur of the moment decision.  But I can understand how that could give the impression of us barring you off (and similar occurances).  I don't think anyone can actually remember the 'going up town' episode.....so its not some form of petty'revenge' for that.  But as Maya said (Joelles blog), we didn't realise you felt like this......and will try to keep it in mind so we can all be a group and everything will be all rosey and corny ;)....... seriously though, sorry guys.  ~benj<\s>hotmail sucks, te he. ^^;  (inside joke)<\s>Oh my gawd,  Joelle updated her personal blog!  *insert stunned emoticon",blog_6348,blog_6348,True

God sent an&nbsp;angel to him in a vision, and told him to send for Peter... Cornelius was so excited about this man of God that he invited all his family and close friends! Peter came, and if you read further on, you'll find out that everyone accepted Christ, and  the Holy Spirit  came down on them. This is the first time in the Bible that the Holy Spirit came down on Gentiles (non-Jews like you and me!)And it was all because one man decided to centre his focus on God.

So...I'm kind of rambling here and, if you're still reading, you're probably hoping I'll just make my point and get on with it. I guess my point is this: We've got to re-think this whole thing. Neither of the current options is good. Spread people out, but destroy more wild habitat in the process? No good. Cram people together, and preserve wild habitat? Also no good. (I don't like being crammed together with other people. I don't like other people's children running around in my yard. I don't want to look at other people's crap in their backyards. If I don't like it, I'm sure lots of other people don't like it.) See? Neither of these options is any good.  We've got to re-think the whole thing. Spread people out, yes. But spread them way WAY out. Put some of them in North Dakota and Montana, for example. There's lots of space there. And get going on this telecommuting thing. Most of the people who live in Fairfax do white-collar type jobs that they could do  anywhere  if they just had the proper telecommuting tools.   I think the federal government should take the lead on this thing. The reason most of the companies that are in this area are  here  is because the federal government is here and they want to be close by to facilitate face-to-face meetings. If the feds moved to telecommuting for most jobs, though, there wouldn't be a need any longer for the contractor companies to locate in this area. They could be anywhere since they'd be meeting electronically with their government contact people.   There are  so many  reasons why a move to telecommuting would be a good idea!

There is no excuse--save severe mental illness--for the abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib. (That is not to say there is no explanation--simply that there is no excuse.)  The blame isn't all hers (Army Spc. Luciana Spencer), though. She and many of the others assigned to interrogate prisoners at Abu Ghraib were not experienced or mature enough to handle the situation there. Each individual there had a moral and legal responsibility to refuse orders (or'suggestions') to abuse prisoners. That so many did not refuse tells me two things: There is an apalling lack of conscience among these young people and there is a frightening unwillingness or inability to take responsibility for their own actions.

Alabama upset Stanford: they're the only other SEC team left, as KY & Miss State were upset by UAB & Xavier, respectively.  - Dad   You better get the DVD, Dad, although JT and Nicole did give me a damn good play-by-play on IM.  I just had my 2nd fantasy baseball draft the other day.  It's a league with JT and Todd and Brandon and some other fools (10 teams total).    I had the 2nd pick, then 19th, 22nd, etc.  My first 5 picks:  Alfonso Soriano Magglio Ordonez Lance Berkman Tim Hudson Jason Giambi  Not bad, right?  But how about these first 5, starting with the 7th pick, then 14th, etc.  Carlos Beltran Pedro Martinez Bobby Abreu Roy Oswalt Jeff Kent (just for fun)  Derek Jeter  That would be JT's team.  Damn.  Oh, and the players I have in both leagues:  Lance Berkman Josh Phelps Octavio Dotel Miguel Batista Francisco Cordero Aquilino Lopez  Basically I have the same RPs in both leagues.  So if Dotel, Cordero, or Lopez suck it...I'm done.  Oh, and I'm having this argument over at AstrosDaily about batting Adam Everett 2nd, which it looks like Jimy is going to do.  I was going to ask JT if there is anything that Jimy has done wrong this spring, because I didn't think there was...now, I stand corrected.  Batting AE 2nd would be a huge mistake.  What are the'reasons' why AE might make a good 2 hitter?  1.  He can bunt guys over, hit and run, and make 'productive outs'. 2.  He's fast 3.  It breaks up the crappy 7-8-9 of Everett/Ausmus/P from last year.  Ok, one by one:  1.  You do not want to make 'productive outs' with the Big 5 coming up.  The Astros do not exactly have the look of a small ball team anyway.  We're basically old, slow, right-handed, and crush the ball.  The Astros should not be playing for the one-run-at-a","s>Marten, you've got admin power back.  If you want to use it to quit again, so be it.  I'd rather we all just forget this nonsense and get back to blogging.  Erin has been the most sensible so far.  These issues are between Michael and Marten, and I would prefer they find another way to fight it out without screwing up the blog for the rest of us.  BTW, who wrote the new description?  I like it. Anyway, it occurred to me that a bunch of blog-worthy stuff has happened to me lately that I haven't written because of the nonsense.  For instance, all the tornados on Sunday.  We were in the basement for around two hours,[Ha! I was in a leaky fallout shelter for about half an hour. It would be nifty if I wasn't pissed about still being there-Marten]  and they came right over us.  Luckily none of them touched down, but we were pretty worried.  It got to the point where we were stashing our valuables in the basement.  Then on Monday, following a note from my grandma's mother, we found her grandfather's grave.  For those of you not keeping track, that's my grandma's great grandfather or my great great great grandfather, Jacob Tanner Snyder, who fought in the civil war.  Not thrity feet from his grave is that of Richard Gattling, inventor of the first automatic weapon - the gattling gun.  And less than a mile away is our shortest running president, William Henry Harrison. So that was pretty cool.  It's not every day you track down a 150 year old relative.

We also saw one of my daughter's classmates with his mother.  We've been wanting to keep in touch with his parents, so I gave my wife a card to give her, along with some paper so that we could get her phone number as well.  It's  this  aspect of the job search that I enjoy the most.  It does provide immediate results, but it plants seeds that may someday come to fruition.<\s>I guess you could call THAT networking   This morning a representative from the local gas delivery company came by to our place.  He stated that he'd been ordered to either collect a certain past due amount of money from us or shut off our service.  I explained to him our family's current situation, and he, while very sympathetic, explained that it would be better for us to not have it shut off and then reconnected again.  Fortunately, we had the amount in the bank account.  Mom was outside with us as well.  I asked if he could take a check, and then went inside to get the checkbook.  I returned to the representative with the checkbook and wrote the check for the past due amount.  I also told him that I was grateful that they hadn't turned the service off when the weather was cold, like it was last month.  The, get this:  he asked me what kind of work I did.  I told him that I did some computer programming, and he said that he might know of someone who could help me.  I asked him if I could give him a business card.  He said yes, and I went back inside to get some business cards I'd made up for myself.  I gave him two of them, in fact.  As the rep took off, Mom mentioned that the guy told her I'd been a lot better than many of the folks he's had to meet about similar matters like this.  Mom thanked him and they got to talking about my being a Christian, and the guy said he could tell I was a Christian by how I'd behaved.

Some people can't handle a success driven, hard working, woman with an opinon.  Its sad to admit, but if I was still male, I would have had a job weeks ago.  I admire the people who have beaten the system and succeeded anyway.  That is one of the reasons you will see a few names under people I admire.  Lynn Conway is there since she showed her old company that she could still work and not only survive but thrive in her old field.  Another one Jude, who also gave me the above advice, has her own business from before her transition. Of course Jude is up there for other reasons, like her giving to the community, and for showing me its ok to be trans and talk freely about her own sexuality.  'Girl you lead by example, thanks, I hope I am as comfortable with my own someday, and figure out my own team, as I want to get the right jersey.'  It took allot of balls ladies to do it in a mans and non trans run world, thanks for the inspiration.  I think it funny that some of the people I know with the biggest balls, no longer have a physical set. I too think I grew a mental set, once I accepted that I needed to get rid of my God given ones.  Anyway, I also need to go see my dad and find some old pictures.  I am particularly interested in one of me at 4 years old on Halloween.  That year I actually convinced my parents to let me go trick or treating as Raggedy Ann.  Hell yeah, I was a four year old cross dresser!  If they only knew then, what they know now.  I also want to find an earlier picture I remember seeing of a two year old me wearing one of my moms old wigs.  Mom had allot of bad perms back in the 70's and still to this day keeps a wig or two around just in case.  When I figure out how to post a picture on here, I will post them so you can chuckle.

People I've never talked to hate me. Hatred is so childish.  And I'm so tired I can't handle it.  I feel disappointed. Disappointed in myself.  I feel really unstable. I think it's from lack of sleep, or frustration...  Being nice to people really backfires sometimes.  I go out of my way to just overwhelm people with kindness, and they stab me in the back...or in the chest. Or both.   It really bothers me that so much effort can be so useless. At least I know that I'm the better person.  I'm too good for some people's shit.  I'm too good to lower myself to certain people.  Quite honestly...in my opinion (which is always rights...and I'm really not joking either)...I'm just plain better than ALL of those people.  The way I see it...anyone who is childish enough to hate me for no reason and hold a delusional grudge...is too far below me for me to acknowledge.  I'm too good to consort with trashy people.  Boy oh boy I sound like a conceited bitch.  Good.  Because with all the effort I have to put into to being nice to some people, and reaping no rewards...I have the right to be a bitch.  And let's face it...I don't have to hold anything back about being slightly conceited...I don't walk around talking shit like I AM the shit...but I can justify who stands below me.  Anyways I need to go to sleep...I can't take this anymore...  G'night crazies.<\s>Ahh today was kinda stupid and somewhat annoying.  I was sick first of all. Then I had to go in for a sonogram and the 'doctor' was pissing me off. He told me that the sonogram was TOTALLY normal, and yet he wants to do a day surgury to diagnose me for something I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE.  How on earth does it make any sense?  And then it would require some six month treatment that would be like a shot every week and a daily pill.  Then after the treatment, there's a good possiblity that I'd never be able to have kids.

The roommate has his checklist, too... I'm sure of it. I think it stays in the back of your mind until some event calls it to the front. For me, most of the time it's knowing that I'm soon to be living alone again. From that moment of first realization until my roommate steps out the door for the last time, I'm going to be thinking of every unwashed dish, every towel tossed lazily on the floor, every missed opportunity to help in any way with the cleaning of the apartment.  But there's always that other side that you're reminded of after the roommate is gone. He couldn't pick up after himself, but dammit he was fun to talk to. And if you're like me, after a couple months, you start to think that the house is too quiet and perhaps another life form would brighten things up. And thus, the cycle begins again.  Maybe next time, I'll spring for a gerbil or something.  There's something kind of Proustian about this Friday night. Don't ask me why but I think it's going to be a good night to settle into 'The Search for Lost Time.' Especially because the title so eloquently expresses my quest of late.<\s>I'll have more to say later today... but for now, check out this  urlLink article from Newseek  about Kim Jong Il and the millions of suffering North Koreans he rules.

It's like conversation with a friend. The best conversations often begin in an aimless way and the meandering along this side street and that leads to topics that provoke new thoughts and insights. I think writing can lead to the same fertile ground.  It's a good exercise for me because I'm a","I began wondering where I was going and if I really wanted to study film.  I wish I could say I did, I wish I could say anything right now, but the truth is I just don't know.  I don't know where I'm going or what I'm going to do, and honestly, that scares the shit out of me.  I know I need that piece of paper.  That's for sure.  But where and when I'm going to get it are HUGE unknowns.  And even before that occurs, there are a ton of things to think about.  Why couldn't I have been like  urlLink Zach Morris  or  urlLink Parker Lewis?  I just feel like I'm always running out of time.  Music for some reason has become a major part of my life in the last six-years.  I think it grew on me so much from driving to work every day for two years when I wasn't in school.  The lyrics mean things and they push past this show I put on and grab me inside.  They twist and turn and every song seems to be singing about me.  Tonight, I landed my  urlLink winamp  player on 'Misunderstood' by  urlLink Wilco.  The entire song has lyrics that just resonate through my life, but there are a few that just give me a little hope, and give me a little hurt.

Monday felt like a Tuesday. Tuesday felt like a Wednesday. Wednesday felt like a Thursday, and today feels like a Friday. I am so very ready for this three day weekend coming up. So in a surge of wishful thinking I went ahead and flipped my calendar to June. And do you know what I found? There are some really  odd  holidays next month. June 7 is 'Accordian Lovers Day.' I would think that for an accordion lover, any day where there's beer and accordions would be a holiday. Which could quite possibly be every night of the week. June 12 is 'Red Rose Day.' What the heck is that? I guess Valentine's day once a year just isn't enough. June 25th is 'Take Your Dog to Work Day.' Seriously, who but a fireman can actually take their dog to work? June 26th is 'National Chocolate Pudding Day.' Mmmmmm sexy!.<\s>I noticed a long time ago that the vision in one of my eyes (the left one) has changed significantly since I've gotten my latest pair of glasses. I've been living with it though and becoming used to it. Today, just moments ago, before I passed gas, I found that my eyes hurt and are more comfortable with my glasses off, and that my vision really is quite bad. I really need to get a new prescription. The only problem is how expensive new lenses are. The ones I've got are scratched anyway. So I'm considering either getting new lenses or just removing my eyeballs and donating them to Monica, since they're crappy anyway.<\s>I have the greatest girlfriend in the world.  urlLink Look at how wonderful she is.<\s>I almost forgot to mention that we got internet back today and I found my telephone on Sunday and got it reactivated.

I want this camp to be about creating a community. Why don't I go back to  urlLink Camp Hollywood  each year even though I had a great time? It's not just because I can't afford it. There's nothing but that promise of a good time calling me back. What if I was made to feel a part of it. All my friends were there and it's like a 'Same time next year' arrangement. What if I wouldn't miss it for anything. Highlight of my year. We aren't going to make a camp like that strictly on bad-ass dancing. Because it excludes people looking to be included, and these people will be our biggest supporters and our biggest promoters. If we can make them feel cool (which is all any of us are really trying to do with this whole 'bad-ass' fiasco).  The people who come just for the bad-ass don't love us, they're lindy whores, they'll go to any event they can get their hands on for their own self-gratification and when we don't give them what they want, they stop coming around and they bad mouth us. That's not the audience I want to cater to. I want to welcome them certainly, and hopefully they can have some good clean fun with us.  I am not ashamed that these are my views. I will not be made to feel stupid for thinking this way. I feel this is a smart and fun and different way to approaching a swing dance event, that I really approach all Omaha Jitterbugs events with. I don't think Cowtown Jamborama should be any different. Don't take yourself to seriously with the whole bad-ass thing. Yes you're a good dancer. Yes we all want to be good and we understand that we can learn something from you. But ultimately we dance because it's fun. We like having fun, so if you give us a weekend full of fun, (rather than hard core, we're better than you, I'm gonna kick your ass in this workshop, I'm going to prove to you how cool I am and nobody else really gets it like Alan and Lisa type workshop) we'll love you.

One of those days that make you wonder if you could have made better use of it. My day started late. Reluctantly woke up at 2P.M. Made myself brunch and even before I realized, I found myself cooking dinner. There were plans to go to the movies with Parshu and Reshma which did not materialize. There were these  usual stints of mental suffocation. I get this numb feeling, a lonely feeling that seems to shut out all the light in the universe. A feeling that I would not want even my worst enemy to go through. Reasons are plenty. Few of them nobody can do anything about, a few in my control and the rest in the hands of an angel. Well, to clear the air with regard to my earlier statement, I have made no enemies all my life. So, it was my third straight day at home. Restless as I was, did the best I could to find myself excuses to leave the house. But that wasn't to be until I received a call from Parshu and Reshma. They had missed the last train to Boston. Next thing i know, we were driving to Boston. It was a quiet ride. We managed to lose our way a couple of times in Cambridge but recovered nevertheless. And now, here I am sitting by myself wondering what the day ahead has in store for me. Strange are the ways of life. Don't you think so?<\s>Let me take the oppurtunity to introduce myself.

I then spent a good ten years of my life in Yercaud. I call it the place of dreams. After which I moved back to Madras to pursue my Bachelors in Engineering. Spent four memorable years there before moving to Boston for my graduate studies. I would hence divide my life thus far into four. My roots trace back to small villages in Kerala.

Mozilla Firefox, on the other hand, is Mozilla's next generation browser.  It also has lots of customization features, and these are easy to use.

I think I like him more now.    What this means essentially is that BAR, Williams, Renault and McLaren have again conspired to trip over themselves and each other to avoid challenging Michael Schumacher to the end. In a race where Rubens Barichello demonstrated the true potential of the Ferrari by starting low and finishing lower, Michael was there for the taking. Unlike his competitors, the stress of not being in superior hardware spurred MS to put in a stunning dive - his competition either alternately retiring due to rear wing failure, not coming into play due to a 10 grid slot penalty or trashing their chanced (and aerodynamics) by driving over bits of Raikonnens McLaren or their own bargeboards.

But it is time to move on to bigger, much better things.  I am ditching this narrowly-focused California Patriot Watch blog, in favor of a broader, all-purpose blog instead.  If the  Patriot  ever updates their site (never certain), I might just see the need to critique aspects of it from my new blog.  Plus, my impending departure to Santa Barbara makes me a lot more likely to deal with local issues there rather than here.  Oh, and what's the new blog gonna be?  It's called:   urlLink The Facts Machine   (http://factsmachine.blogspot.com)  Check it out!  Thanks!  Go Bears!  Go Gauchos!  Go Everybody!<\s>PATRIOT  HILARITY ON SIMON, DAVIS   Looking at Mr. Ratliff's piece on  urlLink Bill Simon and Gray Davis, a couple of sentences jumped out at me:   Therefore, Davis has sought to raise as much money as possible to viciously attack anyone that opposes him...    This was evident when Davis spent an unprecedented $10 million dollars assailing the centrist Richard Riordan during the Republican Primary- a race the democrat Davis should not have been involved with at all.   Second part first...   So Davis shouldn't have been running ads against his potential Republican opponents during primary season, that's an arguable ethical point that could go either way, fair enough.  But gee golly, such a strategy is good enough for Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who attacked Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill McBride in TV ads during the primary season there.  If it's good enough for the Jebster, why not Gray?  Hey  Patriot, contact the folks at the 'Seminole Review' or the 'Hurricane Patriot' or something and tell them to denounce Jeb for using the exact same tactics.  Now the first part...  Political Novice Alert!... The two sentences directly contradict eachother!  Riordan is described by Ratliff as a 'centrist', as opposed to the conservative Simon.  Davis spent money to attack the candidate who opposed him LESS.  Allow me to clue Ratliff in.   The name of","Link 'anti' piece, written by Melanie  'Colmes'  Smith.  But then again, there's this question: How did proponents of the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) come to the conclusion that we are in urgent need of a national definition of marriage? What do they hope to accomplish by defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman? Despite her critical stance on the FMA,  'Colmes'  Smith wouldn't dare think that by throwing the full force of its weight behind the amendment, the White House was even possibly pushing a wedge issue in an election year.  How could she think that, after that lovely Valentine the  Patriot  sent  urlLink last month  (of course, plenty of  Patriot  staff members are male, but we wont go there).  The White House support for the FMA was in the works long before anything Gavin Newsom did; consider the State of the Union address.  And unfortunately -- and here's where the  Colmes  in Smith comes out -- there is no mention of how the language of the FMA would put civil union and domestic partnership legislation at serious risk as well, something many yes-on-unions, no-on-marriages types might not know.  It's particularly maddening when  'Colmes' Smith says: The FMA is already unnecessary in most of the country, as 37 states have passed their own bans on same-sex marriage. But as I mentioned in the previous post, the wording of the FMA seeks to bring the hammer down on more than just marriage.  Over to you, Hannity.  All that being said, Smith's paragraphs on the'sanctity' of marriage and on the causes of broken homes are pretty well done, and credit should be given where credit is due.<\s>CARISSA EXPLAINS IT ALL... ER, SOME   Over the coming weeks/months, it'll be a blast listening to supporters of the Federal  Hate  Marriage Amendment justify their position without citing Leviticus or 1 Romans.  (I get the feeling we'll hear the word 'traditional' used excessively in the near future)  Arguing in favor of the amendment is  Patriot  writer  urlLink Carissa Ritner.

'you almost died!' 'you scared your poor mother so much.' 'we almost lost you before we even had you.'  it's all sort of sad. i'm here now, though, for whatever reason. when i was younger i thought it was because i had some grand purpose to accomplish, but i don't believe that anymore. it was just one freak thing that happened in a lifetime of freakish events. i've come to believe, though, that when i die, i'll die in a car accident: basically, because it seems like i  should  have died in this one, and i'm a big proponent of life going full-circle. i suppose i don't really have a say in the matter, but if you were going to make a movie about my life, kill me off in a car accident at the end. it will make me happy.     i ended up a happy baby after that, too. i started doing the things i love now back then, as you can see from the above picture. these include wearing wife-","Uncle Jack, stamped out cigarettes and became a locomotive. 17 hours later I finished the assignment and had five pages more than I had started out with.

I just don't care to tell the truth. It's too tiring, and I already teach fencing 4 night s week. The last thing I would do to relax is fence two more days during the week. The Long Beach Grand Prix is the same weekend as Faire opens, guess where I'll be?     Today is an air show, the Redlands Bike Classic and a Competition I need to coach at.

Good Will Hunting was good, but watching it with commercial breaks on Bravo sort of killed the flow.  I still need to see  X2, and I want to see the  Italian Job.

I have a small measure of Irish blood coursing through my veins, along with Norwegian, Swedish, German, French, etc. My mom's ancestors seem to have been unable to keep their hands of the tourists. On my father's side, it's easy. They're German. Plain and simple, and I don't think there's anything else. These folks stuck close to home and married their own kind.  I envy my friends who come from Italian or Mexican or culturally Jewish families. They have a sense of tradition and heritage. I hitch a ride to these traditions, getting some vicarious enjoyment out of the experience of joining them for holidays and gatherings. Millions of German-Americans have few, if any, traditions. Many Germans in the midwest in the early 20th century were persecuted during the wars for their heritage. Just as American flags appeared on the doors and in the windows of Indian restaurants all over America after 9/11, Germans during the wars tried to be as patriotic and American as they could.  I know about that oppression from a PBS documentary, not from the experience of my own ancestors, who may or may not have felt pressure to cleanse themselves of their German heritage. But however it happened, the cleansing took place, and I grew up in a home without a single special German dish, holiday tradition, song, piece of clothing, anything.

I developed a plan when I was fifteen: complete a degree, get a mindless job, and write at night. This is proving more difficult than I originally imagined: a mindless job keeps you awake eight hours a day just like any other, and my imagination gets sucked into the ceiling vents; and part of the problem is that I was never a compulsive writer to begin with. When I sit down and do it I do a lot, and I do it well, but I’ve never been a Stephen King, 1500-words-a-day-or-bust sort of person (although when I sit down and do it, 1500 words is hardly enough for me to clear my throat with). So it chugs along in fits and starts. Lots of nail-biting in this vocation.  7. I’m a nice girl but I’m also a hermit, hence some endemic trouble with most of my closer friends, who don’t really like it when I go into a hole for no reason. I’m not the sort of person who calls people just to chat – I’m usually happy to do it when they call me, but for myself it rarely occurs to me. Makes me wonder how Mike and I ever wound up together, because if there’s anyone in the world less likely to pick up the phone than I am, it’s him.  8. I love Mike. Last week we had our sixth anniversary and looked at each other stunned for a few minutes before going to bed (that’s how anniversary celebrations end up playing themselves out, people, just for future reference – last year we drank Diet Dr Pepper and watched Jackass in an awful Glasgow hostel. Really a perfect evening (sincerity)). Six years of someone I have nothing in common with apart from grammar Nazism and a general adoration of all animals, living and stuffed. Really: he’s a fascist and I’m a Reasonable Person. He’s also tall and thin. And I still love him. And for six years it’s been this beautiful thing. And now it’s better than it’s ever been, because, believe it or not","writ from the point of view of English history. The particular bone I have to pick, however, is with Roger Ebert, who gave it 3.5 stars in the  Chigaco Sun-Times.  The man should  know  better!  All right, so perhaps most people don't know that the title of 1st Baron Burghley was most emphatically  not  a consolation prize for William Cecil's forced retirement (he continued to serve her for twenty-eight years following his promotion to the peerage, to his death at age 78), although positing that the scene was 'truly touching' is almost beyond belief. And maybe he didn't know that Francis Walsingham was almost unknown to Elizabeth before he witnessed the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in Paris in 1572 as England's ambassador to that country, and that if he ever truly did win her confidence, it wasn't until after that point, thirteen years after she was crowned (he was approximately her age and far more a babe in the woods than she was).  But here's how Ebert chooses to close off the review:   At the end of the film, Elizabeth announces, 'I have become a virgin.'' And so she remained, ruling over and in some sense creating the England that gave us Shakespeare. Think what a play he might have written about her, if commoners had been allowed to create characters out of reigning monarchs. No doubt he retired in sheer frustration.   Hem. For one thing, there is a common misconception that Elizabeth was some sort of patron of the arts, when in truth she was far more the friend of the bureaucrat than of the playwright. You may or may not know that James I (1603-1625) saw more plays at Court during the first year of his reign than Elizabeth saw in the last thirty of hers. Which brings me to my second point: half of Shakespeare's career - and the most glorious part of it - took place after Elizabeth died. He himself did not die until 1616, and here's a list of what he managed to accomplish after 1603:   Hamlet Troilus & Cressida Alls Well That Ends Well Measure for Measure Othello King Lear Macbeth Antony and Clepatra Coriolanus Timon of Athens Pericles Prince of Tyre Cymbeline The Winter's Tale The Tempest Henry VIII The Two Noble Kinsmen Cardenio   So '[retiring] in sheer frustration' wasn",blog_6570,blog_6570,True
108,"regardless of the arguments for and against, one could say that the American people have already chosen how they wish to be governed (both temporally and morally) because they chose Bush, and also a Republican congress.  The American system is set up to allow for previous administrations to continue to apply morals, and direct the course of the country's laws.  Chief Justice Renquist, and Justice Scalia were appointed by the Regan administration.  Clarance Thomas, by the first Bush administration, and Ginsburg and Breyer were appointed by the Clinton administration.  The effects of previous administrations are felt for decades after their departure from the platform.  There is a lot of talk now about who the second Bush administration will  urlLink choose to replace 'soon-to-be-retiring' justices O'Connor and Renquist.  Now the final catch, is while the Supreme Court decisions can change the laws in a country they can be later reviewed and possibly overturned (most recently has been the possibility of revisiting the Roe v. Wade decision which allowed abortions to be performed).  What are the implications if the Bush administration actually decides to interpret the morals of the Constitution of the United States.  If Congress, the Senate and the President are all of one mind then they might change the constitution to 'clarify' the definition of marraige.  There'll be lots more to watch for.<\s>A Job from my Boss   I just about sat on a piece of paper that my boss had left on my chair for me to find.  It was a job posting, and he had written 'M.

I knew about the job opening, because it's in the office where I first worked in the City.  The 'budget analyst' is leaving, and they are re-classifying the job (something he'd campaigned for while he was in the job).

109,"too.  It’s baaack!    Where can you view it, you ask?  Well you can view portions of it a  urlLink www.georgewbush.com : the official campaign site for President Bush.  Portions of it appear in an online ad for Bush.  The ad starts out with white type on a black background that says, “The Faces of John Kerry’s Democratic Party.  The Coalition of the Wild-Eyed.” It then shows clips of Al Gore, Michael Moore, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt and John Kerry yelling interspersed with clips of Hitler yelling from the moveon.org ad entry.  It then says, “This is not the time for pessimism and rage.”    So I challenge Honsberger: does he object to THIS ad which compares Hitler to various Democrats (and one Independent)?    Will he demand that it be taken down?<\s>We'd like to give a shout out to the astute caller who, while challenging The Honsman and Steven Hayes on the tales of Saddam's son-in-law, seemed to be reading straight off of this  urlLink blog posting.  It's about halfway down - the part about Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani.  Welcome aboard!  Drop  urlLink us  an e-mail, if you're so inclined.<\s>Fred was on LIVE today, and boy was he on-message.  Most of the hour was devoted to an interview with writer  urlLink Steven Hayes.  He's the guy with a book out on the connections between Hussein's Iraq and al-qaeda.  Considering the recent 9/11 Commission report declaring no 'collaborative' involvement between Saddam and al-qaeda, we thought we detected a bit of desperation in the conversation.    Hayes (with Fred's help) brought up some points that had been more or less explained away elsewhere.  For example, they brought up the'urlLink meeting'in Prague between Mohammad Atta and an agent of the Iraqi intelligence service.  As we wrote about this a few days ago (see link) we won't bother to restate it here.    We mention it only because Hayes uses an amazing logical argument to support it and by extension the whole book.  The argument can be boiled down to this: You can't prove it didn't happen","It would seem that the man that the Right (including Honsberger) loves to hate has actually bailed Bush out in the past.  From a David Corn article in  urlLink The Nation:    In 1986, Bush's own oil firm, Spectrum 7, was collapsing. Before it went belly-up, Harken purchased Spectrum for $2.25 million worth of Harken stock and made Bush a Harken director and consultant. That is, Harken saved Bush from ruin.   Why? It wasn't Bush's record as an oil man. He had run two oil companies into the ground. Could it have been Bush's insider credentials as the son of a vice president?   At the time, Harken was owned by global billionaire George Soros, the Harvard Management Corporation, and others.  The article continues:   Later, when I saw the billionaire almost alone, I sidled up to him. 'Nice offices,' I said. 'But can I ask you about some ancient history?' Sure, he said, with a good-natured smile. What was the deal with Harken buying up Spectrum 7? I inquired. Did Soros know Bush back then?   'I didn't know him,' Soros replied. 'He was supposed to bring in the Gulf connection. But it didn't come to anything. We were buying political influence. That was it. He was not much of a businessman.'   Then my time with the billionaire was up. If Soros--who disagrees with most Bush policies--is telling the truth, it means Bush only survived in the corporate jungle because of his surname and connections. Yes, that hardly comes as a surprise. But it does render Bush a purebred embodiment of the central issue of the current business scandals: those on the inside play by a different set of rules than the rest of Americans (including workers and small investors). The market works for Bush--as well as for Martha Stewart and the execs of WorldCom and Enron--in ways others can only imagine, or read about, once in a great while, in an indictment.   Had it not been for Soros and his Harken partners, what might have become of George the Younger? Because a liberal billionaire and his corporate allies sought political juice in 1986--for they knew the business world is no meritocracy--Bush's corporate career was artificially inflated. Consequently, he was able to enter politics, citing his business experience, and land in a",blog_4384,blog_4384,True

So, they come to us and by a $190 Trek mountain bike instead of buying 5 dept. store bike within the month.  How many of you have been keeping tabs on the Great Divide Race?  It was awesome to read and see Mike Curiak beat the tar out of the old record.  I can't imagine how hard that is on the body.  The longgest I have riden has been in my 24 Hour races.  Eventhough the pace is higher, I am still toast afterwords for like a week.  I am sure that Mike and the other riders will be in recovery mode for atleast a month.  Congrats to Mike and the other riders just for trying this!   Check out the race recap with photos at the link below: http://www.mtbr.com/gdr/  As for me, I plan to get some good bike time in today.  I plan on hitting up the local road group ride.  Tonights wepon of choice will once again be my Giant XTC hardtail.  As for tires, I have gone to a bigger tire for more resistance.  I was running a 26 x 1 Ritchey Tom Slick, this time I will be trying to rage on a 26 x 1.95 semi-slick.  This will be my first group ride since my win at the Montana 24 Hour race.  I hope that I can re-adapt to the intensity.  As I like to say....I will bleed out my eyes.  Bring the Pain!  Two weeks and counting until the 12 Hour National Championships in Duluth, Minnesota.  This is the first 12 Hour Nationals that I am aware of.  A lot of people have been posting on the race website asking what classifies this as a 'National' race.  As long as its USA Cycling sanctioned, I believe that is it.  I hope they give out a Stars and Stripe jersy to the winner.  That would be nice to put next to my 7 Iowa State","I had to drop air pressure in my tires and soften up my Fox fork.  That did the trick and I continued to rage.  I kept turning out laps.  I had no idea who was a solo rider on course or a team rider.   Everyrider I would pass I would fly by, acting like I wasn't suffering, but i was, to make them think they were in for a long ride.    The laps continued.  I continued to eat, drink, and keep an eye on my equipment.  It couldn't have went any better.  The night riding went pretty quick.  The Cateye Stadium 3 light I was riding turned the high plains in to day.  My night laps were just as fast as my day laps.    I survived the night with no problems.  Day light broke, and looking at the results, I had accumulated a 4 lap lead.  For the rest of the race i just keep riding, keeping the pace nice and easy.  In the end, I had turned out 16 laps on the 15 mile loop.  The closest rider to me was at 12 in the end.  Overall, I felt pretty good.  The only thing super sore was my ass, from having to ride the hardtail for 15 laps.  I could have asked for a better race.  Everything worked good!  The WTB Epic Wolf tires had awesome hookup, the Fox fork saved my body, and the Cateye Stadium 3 headlight kept my speed up at night.  I recommend this race to anyone!  The people are super nice, the entry fee is only $50, the course will kick your ass, and if you win you get imortalized in local cafe (I am the only solo winner NOT from Montana in the races history).  The Stockman Cafe is who gets all the money from this race.  They treat you like a god!  They serve a meal after the race, that is worth the drive alone.

And while I wait for a return on those edits, while I wait for more work on book two, I have been toying with the idea of working with some ideas that have been swimming in my head.  What else is swimming in my head right now:  -My mother has been very ill lately has been watching far too much TV since she became nearly immobile.  She called me last night and begged me to turn the television on to MTV.  We watched Ashlee Simpson's reality TV show together by phone.  Sick, isn't it?  We're more like sisters than mother and daughter, though.    Anyway, I noticed that young little Ashlee has a new record contract and all these exciting things going for her and she drops her boyfriend's (or is it ex-boyfriend now...gasp!)name every other word (along with  like  and  oh my god ) and obsesses about where he is, what he is thinking, if he is thinking of her, and talks about how all the songs she writes are about him, and on and on and on and I see with this why young girls and boys in their adolescent naivety prime should NEVER be given television shows.  She is going to watch this show in two years and cringe.  She is probably already watching this behavior and cringing.  I think the moment you make your talent, your art, the thing you do in life all about someone else, the moment you mix up events of your romantic life with what you do and use them as an indicator and also as a publicity tool, you have lost it all.  And coincidentally, she lost her boyfriend before the end of the episode.  Coincidence?  I think not.    -I was recently given a bit of an indicator of how weird people get about personal relationships of anyone whose name is anything of note, and it totally freaked me out.  I had no idea anyone paid attention to, and especially commented publicly about me or my boyfriend, or about our personal relationship...But they do apparently.  And it's not like either one of us are famous in any way.  Of course, we are talking about chat rooms and those bulletin board things online and all that sort of fringe of society behavior that I don't pay attention to anyway.

S: 'Sin-San, do you do facial ga, you need ga wor. It will help the acne' R: Ahhh, no thank you la. thanks.  And I ran out crying, because I so freaking ugly!!!!

What else could be better??    I went to the mall yesterday and got lots of makeup.  Yes the best thing for a girl, makeup.  I got this koooollll lipgloss that burns my lips and feels so funny.  I went to Hot Topic and found the PERFECT shoes!  My mom would have bought them but they didn't have my size, it so P-ed me off!  There was this guy at the store, and usually the guys that work at Hot Topic overdo the look.  But this guy was perfect, he didn't have toooooo much.  He told me that he liked my shirt.  It was the 'If you have something to say shut up' shirt.    I called Joseph Saturday.  He said he made a girl cry.  They had a dance Friday night and this girl had wanted to dance with him and he didn't know it.  She was standing up near him and tried to talk to him and was stuttering and everything and she ran off crying.  He danced with her, so she was happy I guess.  He just HAD to call his girlfriend when we were on the phone and just had to ask her if I had an accent.  He finds my voice funny because he lives up north and I live here.  He thinks I have a Spanish accent or whatever.  YEAHHH.....right.  I don't.  Alright, I'm gonna go because well....I'm bored.  Bye!

This includes everyone from the CEO to the person who serves tea - every role is important. Hence, we need a mindset that reveres everyone who puts in honest work.   Indians become intimate even without being friendly. They ask favors of strangers without any hesitation. For instance, the other day, while I was travelling from Bangalore to Mantralayam, I met a fellow traveller on the train. Hardly five minutes into the conversation, he requested me to speak to his MD about removing him from the bottom 10 per cent list in his company, earmarked for disciplinary action.   I was reminded of what Rudyard Kipling once said: A westerner can be friendly without being intimate while an easterner tends to be intimate without being friendly.   Yet another lesson to be learnt from the West, is about their professionalism in dealings. The common good being more important than personal equations, people do not let personal relations interfere with their professional dealings. For instance, they don't hesitate to chastise a colleague, even if he is a personal friend, for incompetent work.   In India, I have seen that we tend to view even work interactions from a personal perspective. Further, we are the most 'thin-skinned' society in the world - we see insults where none is meant. This may be because we were not free for most of the last thousand years.   Further, we seem to extend this lack of professionalism to our sense of punctuality. We do not seem to respect the other person's time. The Indian Standard Time somehow seems to be always running late. Moreover, deadlines are typically not met. How many public projects are completed on time?   The disheartening aspect is that we have accepted this as the norm rather than an exception. Meritocracy by definition means that we cannot let personal prejudices affect our evaluation of an individual's performance. As we increasingly start to benchmark ourselves with global standards, we have to embrace meritocracy.   In the West, right from a very young age, parents teach their children to be independent in thinking. Thus, they grow up to be strong, confident individuals. In India, we still suffer from feudal thinking. I have seen people, who are otherwise bright, refusing to show independence and preferring to be told what to do by their boss. We need to overcome this attitude if we have to succeed globally.   The Western",blog_3267,blog_2767,False
115,"our affection. We ended the night playing a game of Scrabble and watching the Lakers Game, with a second trip to the kitchen for a reload of ribs. At the end of the night, we called each other when we reached our destinations, to let someone know we were safe. And one thing I couldn't help but notice was a flaw in all of us. None of us had sustained a female group of friends. I realized that this was in part due to the fact that we have that support and cohesiveness located in our family. I guess I'll always be horrible at making friends and resistant to spending extended time with women who don't know me or understand me because the Swanigan women were there from the beginning. They know my soul and I know theirs. Peace...<\s>I don't know how exactly do you train someone to work for HELL, INC., selling their employment soul to the devil, but I got a crash course today. As my last day at work (August 6, 2004) approaches, I am admittedly getting a little sentimental. Aside from the ultimate dude's beezlebub likeness and lascivious nature, he's actually a teddy bear. He had one of those rare human moments yesterday at work. He bought those of us who were still at work around noon, lunch from the tasty new hot dog eatery across the street and held our attention at the conference table, embellishing stories about psychotic former love interests. Oddly and ironically enough, it was the first time I noticed that he has blue eyes. I mean, don't get me wrong, I have always looked him in the eye. I was taught at an early age to look people directly in the eye when you speak to them and give a firm handshake. But I guess I was looking past the facade and exterior and finally seeing the real him.   Sh!t like that always happens to me when I am about to get the heave ho. Oh, well.  I've been training my replacement all day today and will continue to do so all next week. Everybody claims they're quite sad about my departure. Since ultimate dude can't keep a secret (even though he lies like he's telling the truth), let the cat out of the bag about the 'Sayanara Sweetie' corporate function next Friday. Plus after work, I having drinks with the Tennessee Tiaras, the unofficial blog club in Memphis.

First of all, I do not dislike him because he is a republican. I am not a partisan voter. I vote for the best man. I just look like a Democrat. I dislike him because he has made life for me and those like me, a living hell. I am treking to grad school due to the lack of a sufficient economic growth which inherently determines the employment or rather unemployment market. I hate when people tell unnecessary lies. Example: When your 'elected' leader tells you we are at war due to the suspicion of weapons of mass destruction when he really just wants to capture the dictator that put a hit out on his father. There's a smidgen of honor in that actually. I know if someone attempted to destroy Stephen B. Hines, all of the South Memphis/ Third World would rise out of me. So Bush honestly, has gotten his part of the deal but what have we gotten. Absoluetely nothing. All we get for Christmas is the remains of a loved one or a message like the one that appeared in my inbox today. I know that war is the inevitable. But I wonder is there an alternative. Maybe we should draft the criminals and felons on death row to stand on enemy lines? He'd probably go for that since 90% of them are black men due to our (expletive) criminal justice system. I don't even read the headlines regarding the war anymore because I'm too busy at the gas station filling up my tank with $2 a gallon gas. What surprises me most is that he hasn't been assasinated yet. (Please welcome my newest blog readers-the CIA, FBI and the Secret Service.) I am totally against violence and I would hate for him to be assasinated because (1) I am a Christian and (2) our alternative (VP Cheney) is highly unreliable. I'm just tired of people dying and America's blood and tears saturating the soil. Its not completely Bush's fault though, we all know who the real enemy is...Peace.<\s>Just surface conversation today. I've had enough of trying to 'permeate the epidermis'...

Just relaxation until that comes...  ***<\s>I just had a very heated debate with my mom earlier over the state of 3rd World / Developing Nations. I came away pretty offended by what she said and pissed off. I never really thought about my parents being conservative until now. The debate came about from my mom mentioning that my dad's friend who is in town is a factory owner in Vietnam. I said something about how I'm against the'slave' labor in factories all over the world. She said that she thought it was a good thing, because people can now work. She goes on to talk about how countries are corrupt and messed up because of the people. She believed that they should just get their acts together. That enraged me. To me it's attitudes and ignorance such as that, which helps to perpetuate the horrible situations that exist in many nations caused by imperialism (cultural, political, and economic). This was the same sort of anger that I felt after hearing ignorant people call up talk radio shows. The lack of understanding of historical developments in nations and the result of those developments keeps people from fully understanding why so many things in the world are the way that they are. Then they formulate ignorant rationales for why they are the way they are.  *<\s>Wow I discovered that  The Hives  will be on the  urlLink  Spiderman   soundtrack. That's pretty amazing.

I've seen the village, and its so serene and innocent! At least it was in 1989, yes its true, I have neglected the homeland for over 12 years now. I really haven't had much say in the decision making process. Three years ago I wanted to go back to visit, after I graduated. It didn't happen due to family issues. Since then my own dream has been to go make umrah with my family and go to Bangladesh for a month or so. Problem is, the political condition of Bangladesh is awful. Hartal (strikes, which often become very violent) are all over the country... roads, even cities, are closed for them. Mafia-style crime is rampant as well, in addition extreme Islam is rising. At this point, it is literally life-threatening for a woman to travel the streets alone. And yet, I look back to racing my 4 yr old brother to the nearest vendor to buy a Fanta and some 'chanachur' with the allowance my grandfather gave us (when I was 6). I never did take the time to know my grandfather on my dads side (Dadu) very well, I was too young to understand, but I do remember how much he loved us. He cherished me particularly because I was his first grandchild. Wrote me a song for my aqiqah, which was held belated in Bangladesh (perhaps so my dadu could attend), that all my relatives sang to me.   My most precious memory though is a simple letter. My dadu wrote me a letter at the end of January 1991 (I was 10). He asked me why I hadn't written to him, how he was getting old and would be leaving the world soon, that the sound of my voice (specifically, when I spoke English), was like music to his ears, that grandchildren and grandparents historically are best friends, but I hadn't kept up my end of the deal. Within three weeks, he died of a stroke, inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun. It was my grandfather's last letter. :(  Looking back, I don't know if there was anything else I could do to heal.

The set lasted a couple of hours, and the energy was fantastic.  The band really seemed into it to me, and the audience fed off that electricity.  The crowd was large, the night before was sold out, but the great thing was it wasn't too hard to get around and get beer.  Lots of young kids there also.  I had forgotten about the dreaded double X they put on both your hands.  I don't miss those days.  So check these guys out live if you ever get the chance, they put on a hell of a show.  There is something about a good concert that gets me excited.  Lots of things have to go right, like the right crowd, good sound system, and of course a great band.  But when all of those things come together, there is nothing that beats a live show.  I told Dave I am going to have to keep an eye out for more concerts to attend.  Like Dave said, they aren't many better ways to blow twenty bucks than seeing a great live show.   urlLink Here  is a link to the pics from the show.<\s>I had a lot going on this weekend so I better catch up on my posts.&nbsp;   Saturday a good friend of mine, and a buddy I coach with got married.&nbsp; It was a beautiful wedding and I am very happy for the two of them.&nbsp; Now for a couple of observations from that day.   First, I was an usher for the first time and hated it.&nbsp; People get really picky about where they want to sit, and when you have to ask people to move down away from the aisle they look at you like you just shot their dog.&nbsp;","stayed at one school is five years.  I know it was time for RC to go, but he was a class act.  I will be going back to College Station at the end of the season to see A&M play Tech again.  I wonder if the people in Kyle Field will still be loving Coach Fran if the Aggies go through another season like last year?<\s>Please excuse me for going off on a Seinfeld type rant, but an experience today was too much.  I went to get my haircut today at a Procuts.  Not a great place, but the only place around that isn't a twenty minute drive.  So for once I had no wait and was pretty excited, I was thinking in and out in fifteen minutes.  Not the case.  Why do people who cut hair feel like they have to make small talk?  Do people like to talk to strangers while they are getting their hair cut?  I don't, and especially when they ask a thousand questions.  And then even more personal questions.  Example:  Tammy: So where do you live?  Me: Over in Justin.  Tammy:  Oh me too! (Problem already)  Me:  That's nice  Tammy:  So where in Justin?  Me:  Behind the Justin Boot store. (Really the only true landmark in Justin)  Tammy: What street?  Now come on, do we have to get that specific?  Some fat, 40 year old lady who is married with four kids (according to her) asking what street I live on.  And the worst is when they stop cutting to talk, because they can't do two things at one time.  When I go get a haircut I don't mind a little small talk, even though I could do with none at all.  This lady though just kept on and on and on.  Don't talk, just give me my average haircut and let me go on my way.  I guess this was a better experience though than the last time when I went in.  There were four people ahead of me and two ladies cutting hair.  When one lady finally gets to me she decides to go on break when there are now six people behind me, leaving one lady to cut hair.  I hate getting my hair cut.  On a lighter note I am going to the Robert Earl Keen show tonight at Billy Bobs.

I had to take a mighty pull on my cigarette before I read it, because I saw my name in big red letters right underneath the headline 'Future Pathetic,' but it ended up being very sweet, actually.  Now for Elizabeth and Mary.  A few years ago I concluded that most people believe that one cannot admire both Elizabeth and Mary, and I don't really see why. Certainly, they were enemies for what was a very high-profile (but relatively short) period in both of their lives, and their reigns were entirely different. However, as unlikely as it may seem, I have almost unlimited respect for them both.  One only has to take the briefest scan across Mary's life in its entirety to see that forces beyond her control doomed her almost from the beginning. She was the daughter of a woman who made herself the enemy of the Court; her stunted growth made it impossible for her to be strategically married off when she was still young. However, she had much of the cleverness of  Catherine of Aragon, as well as the charisma of her father  Henry VIII. One can see that immediately by the way she repossessed her throne from  Jane Grey  and  Northumberland's  forces, and later, as Queen, crushed the  Wyatt rebellion  that threatened her rule. She was gifted at inspiring loyalty, this much is clear.  But as Julian Martin, one of Canada's foremost Tudor historians, puts forth, Mary was the foundational catalyst for the English forever associating Catholicism with foreign rule.

If you scroll down you'll see that there's a difference between the actual temperature and 'what it feels like'. At press time, it's actually -26 Celsius, but it feels like -42 owing to the wind. Balmy, compared to the past week.  No matter what you think about Canadians, no one is enjoying this. We are prepared to deal with all manner of malevolent weather, but this? Now the inside of HUB Mall (see above) probably actually feels colder than walking outside in downtown London. And I'm finished with it, and here's why: because I spent eight months of my life going from country to country telling people not to believe everything they hear about Canada - about us in igloos, and flannel jackets, and this bloody cold weather - for an Edmonton winter, think New York City. Usually.  And then I get back here to this weather, and snow everywhere, and traffic at a standstill, and for the first time in my life I heard the word 'hoser' used in a conversation completely free of irony.

The 20th Anniversary Tour features Darlene Love, Georgia Engel, Mimi Hines, Lee Meriwether and Kaye Ballard, all of whom were wonderful to work with. I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with Kaye Ballard, former Clevelander and big-time Broadway belter.  In case you don't know much about her, here's her bio:      KAYE BALLARD Instantly recognizable from her numerous television appearances (particularly her co-starring role with Eve Arden in the cult hit series, MOTHERS-IN-LAW), Kayes stage career includes starring roles on Broadway in THE GOLDEN APPLE, CARNIVAL, MOLLY and THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE, off-Broadway in Ben Bagleys DECLINE AND FALL..., OVER THE RIVER and her one woman show, HEY MA! and elsewhere in GYPSY, NUNSENSE and dozens more. Most recently she starred on tour in THE FULL MONTY, in the pre-Broadway tryout of QUARTET (a new play by Ronald Harwood) and as Mama Brice to all 15 Fanny Brices in the all-star concert version of FUNNY GIRL at the New Amsterdam Theatre, home of the original Ziegfeld Follies. Kaye also starred in many films, her favorite being Terrence McNallys THE RITZ. On recordings, Kaye introduced such standards as Lazy Afternoon, Fly Me To The Moon and Maybe This Time. She currently lives in Palm Springs with her three lhasa apsos, who arent the least bit impressed by any of it.   Over the course of our week together, we talked almost non-stop about theater, Broadway, the most incredible production of Follies  ever  that she co-starred in, and about family, history and our shared love of dogs. She is my new best friend. I was invited to her sister's home for an enormous luncheon for the cast and crew, which was as delicious as it was fun.

Then I get even more bummed.  But then I began to realize, these qualities etc that he talks about, are very similar (if not exactly the same) to the fruits of the Spirit found in Galatians 5:22 & 23 (let me refresh your memory--and mine!)   'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.'   And so as this thought passes through my mind, I'm encouraged because just as I cannot conjure up the fruits of the Spirit, I don't believe I can conjure up the six qualities stated above.  It's from God.  It's not about me.  It's about loving God and allowing God to work in me and His Spirit produces the love, joy, etc.  And His spirit will also produce in me the courage and persistence and all the other qualities--if I yield to Him.      I think we try to make things so complicated by figuring out the latest communication techniques to improve our relationships or trying to decide what kind of punishments we should provide when our children disobey or what to do when things go wrong, when really it all comes down to giving our lives to God and following Him daily.  He will give us the strength to make it through each thing that comes our way--if only we turn to Him.  I know in my own life there have been many times when instead of immediately turning to Him, I turn to a friend or relative, or book, or magazine to figure out how to deal with what's going on.  Don't get me wrong, these things can be a help, they can give you some really practical advice.  But the bottom line is that it all comes back to your relationship with God and if you're allowing Him to produce His fruits through your life or if you are trying to do it on your own. :)  Ok, so back to the books I'm reading.   The Warning  by T. Davis Bunn was pretty good.  Not a great read, but interesting.  It's about a man who is called by God to warn God's people that an economic disaster is coming.","I'm organized.  Not extremely, but I'm definitely organized more than most people.   2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  Yes I do.  I have a calendar on my computer that I update almost daily and I also have a calendar in my notebook for work that I keep updated.  I would forget everything if I didn't have these two things.  And I constantly make 'to do' lists for home and work.   3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?  Organized--yes.  Here is the stack for bills, here is the stack of things that need to be put away and here is a stack of things that haven't been gone through and here's a stack for my hubby to go through..etc you get the picture.  (I may be organized, but I'm not very neat)   4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  My CDs are not alphabetized, but probably because they are just stacked on a shelf that is hard to see.  My movies are all alphabetized. (which is no easy task when you have 3 kids under the age of 7 who really don't care that Care Bears starts with C and needs to go on the top shelf..lol)   5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  Girl Scouts!  I don't know why, but I'm having a hard time getting it together.  I think it's because it's new and I really am lacking time lately to get it done.<\s>Friday Five!   It's that time again... :)   You have just won one million dollars:    1. Who do you call first?

Others thought that his personal life took a special twist every Wednesday morning. All of us was way wrong! Turns out, one fine day he spoke of how he froze his ass in the States for his degree. And being a bookworm and not coming from a rich family, he worked part-time as a librarian in the university. From then, he always waited for the mid of the week to pass before he could finally put his studies aside and work the weekends ( there's some ruling that says students can't be too engrossed in working or something like that ). Why the afternoon meant more was simply because it was the climb to the peak of the hump and by the time you are through eating, you'll be satisfied and heading for the weekend in due time.  Simple logic that works for many people. Even one as bored and as unsure of what to write on this Humpday. Probably that's why when a holiday falls on Wednesday, you hardly feel like you turned in a week's work.<\s>Black Monday  After being away for ten days, I was extremely sadden to say that I’m back to work and fully operational. And right from the start of the day, the darkness of a black Monday could have been felt deep down my bones.

Though the initial idea as to why I did it in the first place was still in tact, the break was meant to forgive and forget the previous working life I had.

133,".   10:02 p.m.  – The delay notwithstanding, I’m glad they opened the roof.  Berkman is now banging the ball entirely out of the park with regularity.  This is what makes the Derby so much fun to watch.  I still would have preferred to see Griffey, but Berkman is doing quite well in his place.   10:12 p.m.  – Tejada just hit his fourth, so Bonds is done (Berkman hit 10).  Unfortunately, Tejada’s at-bat is being virtually neglected by commentators Chris Berman and Joe Morgan, who are talking to Reggie Jackson.   10:21 p.m.  – Tejada just hit his 15th, which is a single-round record for the Derby.  The fans outside the stadium are in a dogpile, trying to get the ball.  That home run is his last, but he’s in the Finals.  On one hand, I’d say he doesn’t have enough left to win it, but he seemed to get stronger as he went.  If he’s up against Berkman, that could be a great round.  Again, it comes down to what Palmeiro does.   10:25 p.m.  – Bonds, out of the competition, has changed out of his uniform and into street clothes.  I can’t say why, but he looks like a woman.  An ugly woman, yes, but a woman nonetheless.   10:33 p.m.  – Palmeiro bores the crowd to death and only hits...um, a few.  I’m not even sure how many, but it wasn’t enough to move on.  It’ll be Berkman and Tejada in the finals.   FINAL ROUND    10:41 p.m.  – Berkman finishes with four home runs.  I think Tejada’s got this one in the bag.   10:51 p.m.  – Tejada just hit his fifth, and the Derby is over.  He wins.  A little anticlimactic after the showcase of the first two rounds, but it was a good show anyway.<\s>I noticed this morning that I only posted four entries to my blog last week.  I'll try to get back","is for any  Office Space  aficianados who may be lurking.  In truth, there was a little bit more to it than that...but not much.  The whole thing started with Brandi coming into Bowling Green on Tuesday night.  She was scheduled for an interview in BG on Wednesday afternoon, so she drove over to my place when she got off work on Tuesday.  She had much of the day free on Wednesday, so I decided to burn a vacation day and take it off with her.  It was a perfect,  Ferris Bueller -esque kind of day for it.  You know...'How could I possibly be expected to handle school on a day like this?'  In my case, being at the ripe old age of 26 and out of college for going on four years now, it was work rather than school, but the general concept was the same.  I saw no point in coming to work and sitting here with nothing to do while behind me a large window looked out on a perfectly beautiful day that I would be unable to enjoy.  So I stayed home, and I'm so glad I did.  Brandi and I slept in until 11:00 with the window open so we could enjoy the breeze.  She decided to skip her interview (which was for a part time position she wasn't all that interested in anyway), so we had the whole afternoon together.  We had Chinese food for lunch, then ran around town a little bit, culminating in a trip to the local Dairy Queen.  We took our overflowing ice cream cones to the picnic bench outside and basked in the sun, watching traffic, road construction workers, and people flowing in and out of the rental management office across the street.  We hung out for a bit after that, and Brandi had to leave at 4:00 to be at work.  I played some PlayStation basketball after she left (in front of the windows, of course), and then drove to Stow to join her for the evening after she got off work.  We had a nice, relaxing evening, eating pizza and watching a movie.  Then we went to bed, and I got up early this morning and came to work.  I do this from time to time, and it's always nice to have a day off in the middle of a week.  It helps me to recharge.

Chris works for a trucking company that delivers to Houston from here in Waco.  Right now, the place where they deliver to is running slow and instead of cancelling drivers, the foreman still has all the drivers running.  So, instead of having a 10 hour shift it's more like 12 or more. Plus the other drivers have this nasty little habit of stealing things out of the other trucks.  Each driver is suppose to have their own mallet to bang on the truck (they deliver powdered limestone).  Now someone in the company has stolen four mallets out of Chris's truck.  These mallets aren't cheap, they're like 20 to 50 dollars each, depending on which mallet he gets.  So, now we're out of a mallet once again.  This one, I swear if it gets stolen again, heads will roll.  But of course, Chris says that he will beat the person who has the mallet, then I'll have his head on a platter.  Is that wrong?  But it's really getting on our nerves constantly having to pay for another mallet.   Ok, to some up, my husband and I have issues.

When it's their turn, they ask for a pack of cigarettes.  The cashier too busy to look up and notice the person looks like they're 15, rings up the beer and sells the cigarettes to said customer.  A minute later, two police officers walk in and arrest cashier on the spot of selling to an underage consumer, aka- sting operation.   So, first thing this morning I get a lovely phone call from the regional supervisors girlfriend telling me about the whole thing and 'to be forewarned'.

The weirdest thing though was looking down and seeing 2 lumps where the ball's impact had separated my leg fat and muscle...yeah its big and blue/black with red in the middle 6 in circle on the front of my leg which hurts and shaving is interesting.  I can't where pants...that hurts the bruise.  And what really gets me is I might not be able to play in Wed soccer game against our other team because if I get hit in the leg, which in soccer happens frequently, I might kill someone due to the pain I will be in.  My car ended up not needing breaks according the guy at the mechanic shop so...dad will have to check them out for me when I see him in Sept.  Today...has been one of those days...I don't know if I told you but I am presenting a poster in Aug and in Sept at different conferences...but same basic concept.  The conference in Aug is with the Walther Cancer Research Center here at ND and since my work used to be funded by the center we decided to show support and I would give a poster (my work is now funded by a 1 M $ NIH grant).  Well I was automatically entered into a contest when I entered and I found out today I won...this is not good...now to any other grad student they would be thrilled.  A 2nd year grad student being elected to give a 15 min presentation with 5 min of questions in front of about 200 of there peers and advisors would be thrilled, this is a very good sign.  I however am petrified...I don't do public speaking. So when I got this email my first reaction was horror and running into my bosses office saying holy crap...","He may have done a stupid thing this fall, but I like Mike.. he's a good friend, and I'd really hate to see him have come this far only to fall short of the last semester of the course.  Granted, he's already out of the running for a degree, but there's still the option of the certificate, and then there's the knowledge available to him whether he gets either the degree or the certificate.  I hope they let him stay.<\s>I can't believe I forgot the OSGA meeting yesterday.  I'm secretary for the student government here on campus, and way back in September when we all went to the Leadership conference in Oklahoma City, Joanna, our illustrious leader, volunteered our school (without discussion among the rest of student government, or the dean of student affairs) to host the Oklahoma Student Government Association this month.  So she sticks her nose out, trying to take charge and make us look impressive and show off and... our student government sucks, she's the only one who wanted them to come, and guess what?  She's the only one who attended yesterday!  Granted, I in all honesty had completely forgotten about it, but I don't know what happened to Melinda, and why she didn't attend.  Suffice to say, I think Joanna is a little pup who's trying to play with the big dogs.  A little two year college in some po-dunk town in the middle of Nowhere with nothing to do except look at cracking sidewalks and 100 year old buildings that are still, for some reason, being used to hold classes in, has no business hosting a state's student government meetings for one month.  She did this, and dragged people from all over the state, some of them 4 - 5 hours away, to come and hold a meeting and then tour the campus to look at said cracked sidewalks, and cow plop.  Yes, cow plop.  Joanna decided that it would be interesting to take them back to the Vet Tech area and show them around the barn where the...  people  around here place bets on which square a cow will deposit on.  I keep trying to remind myself that we only have six and a half months left in this state, in the worthless house, in this next to nothing town.<\s>I've decided to move my page from Angelfire to Fortunecities for a couple of reasons.

All in all, Rupert is doing poorly..he made a mess of the reward challenge in my opinion, Ethan's future looks much brighter.  Richard is by far the best player and has a great chance of winning if he can dodge Tribal Council for awhile until he gets some friends.  He is so smart about people, but he himself is such a jerk (or appears to be..like I really know him!)!  Colby is doing well with Richard on his team, it gives him a chance to not stand out.

The downtown art museum offers a great mix of films that usually don't hit our mainstream theaters (although you might be surprised what hits our mainstream theaters here, a lot of really great stuff).  However the museum has been reluctant to show Jandek On Corwood for some odd reason.  There is hope, however.  In Norman, OK there is an organization called BOFFO.  It is an organization that usually showcases local films however they do occationally get one from one of the coasts.  Since it is very popular now I figured I could set up a screening through BOFFO.

Presumably, the pro-Sharon neoconservative cabal brings about  the result of a pre-fascist atmosphere in America. It is quite remarkable that the Pax Americana of the future  provides a pretext for  an act of international violence that exceeds even those of the 'liberal' Bill Clinton. It appears that Bushs argument for war leads our attention to  the final subjugation of the Middle East, beginning with the $90bn invasion of Iraq.   Nevertheless, the 15-minute speech delivered Monday night by President Bush  leads our attention to  the seizure of the Iraqi Oil Ministry. As Norman Mailer pointed out, Bushs argument for war represents the crushing of internal dissent in order to propagate  the resurgence of White Supremacist ideologies. Perhaps for the first time since the late 1940s, the influence of Leo Strauss is solid evidence of the theocrat Ashcroft's suspension of our civil rights. This suggests that the pro-Sharon neoconservative cabal is determined by capitalist interests which lead to the police state which has come to pass.   -Random words put together by The Lefterator: A Leftest Cant Generator   http://www.spinline.net/cy/lefterator.pl<\s>My 25th permanent post, a milestone.

Speaking of Pre-Orders, Haloblack's THROB is also available for pre-order (see www.thesickcity.com for details). I point this out because the album is being released by my dear friend Gilez over in the UK via his label Armalyte (http://www.armalyte.com/). Gilez has come a long way in the few years I've known him. Introduced to me by jared, Gilez put us on his Defcon 1 compilation and then brought the aggression over to the UK in 2001 for the release show. We've remained friends ever since. He's a helluva guy and a good family man. He works hard and it's good to see him being able to release an album of this calibre. It legitimizes him.

This could happen 10 years from now for all I know. It's not going to be Hypefactor, and probably not the aggression.

Do birng your NRIC (Passport for non-Singaporeans) or Donation Card if you wish to donate blood. Regards, Judy  ---------------------  I used to be a pretty regular blood donor. NUS was just next to NUH blood centre. But since i started work 2 yrs ago, i think i have only donated blood once. Hence, my inital thoughts was 'Let's go!!'. &nbsp;  My chain of thoughts were if nitrogen narcosis was to happen,&nbsp; by giving blood,&nbsp; it would reduce the amount of nitrogen that can possibly be infused since there&nbsp;would be reduction of the amount of blood in my body,&nbsp;ya?  Nonetheless, i decided to ask the wise one --  urlLink www.google.com &nbsp;:o)   from  urlLink http://divermag.com/archives/april2000/divedoctor_apr00.html   Diving after Blood Donation By Dr. Sawatzky  How does donating blood affect diving?   For the first few hours/days after donating blood, the person will be more susceptible to fainting and will have a reduced exercise capacity. After the blood volume that was lost in the donation is replaced, the person will no longer be prone to fainting and might actually have a slightly improved exercise capacity. There are theoretical slight increases in the risk of oxygen toxicity and DeCompression Sickness but this change in risk most likely has no practical significance. You should never dive (nor do other strenuous activity) the day of a blood donation and should be sure to drink lots of nonalcoholic fluids after donating blood. It should be okay to do conservative dives the next day but if you want to be absolutely certain you have recovered from the acute effects of donating blood,  wait 72 hours.    &nbsp; The CONCLUSION  Think i will give this donation a miss.&nbsp; Afterall, I already have a","Success. It can come with handcuffs.  Research into the “imposter syndrome” first began in 1978 by two psychotherapists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes who studied a group of successful, high-achieving women. They found that these women had high levels of self-doubt and an inability to internalise their success. They believed they were “fooling” other people, that they got where they did because of contacts or luck — even when a reality check proved that the exact opposite was true. External proofs of excellence — academic degrees, awards, promotions — were routinely dismissed. As researcher Dr Valerie Young put it: “Rather than offering assurance, each new achievement and subsequent challenge only serves to intensify the ever present fear of being...found out.”  Often it’s the smartest people who suffer most. As children they are told how intelligent and exceptional they are. And then, as they grow up, they invariably encounter tasks that are not so easy, where they don’t have all the answers. Suddenly they have to accept that they aren’t so special, that they may actually be only average, even dumb...an imposter. It’s the dirty little secret many smart people share — and no one tells.  I personally know dozens of “imposters”. Like this man who worked very hard to become CEO of his company, got the job — and is now panicking because suddenly he thinks he’s not really good enough for it. Or another friend who sings beautifully but thinks he’s a fraud because he doesn’t sing as well as Bhimsen Joshi. Or this young woman I know who started out as a secretary and who at age 29, is now vice-president of a very successful company. A hard-working, determined woman, she has also managed to build her own home, one of the youngest people I know to have done so. And yet she too feels like a fraud. But if she is a fraud, then who was it who achieved all those successes?  A few weeks ago I reconnected with an old friend, a gifted journalist, via e-mail. She has done remarkably well for herself in the software industry, spearheading a project that was good enough to survive the dotcom typhoon.

The main theme is her disappointment that she didn’t get to attend this bizarre “Orgasmatron” party in the city somewhere (a prelude to the Burning Man festival, she says). “You couldn’t get anyone to come with you?” I ask (the innocent poker face lasts perhaps a half second before I crack up like a kid who just made the obvious poop joke).          Later in the same conversation, this friend describes the ads she’s posted on  urlLink Craigslist, in search of that rare thing: a Jewish guy who likes to travel. (I once sought an intellectual grease monkey, so she has my sympathies.) Not long ago she met or heard from a guy who was Jewish and somewhat pleasing, but got panic attacks about leaving the country. “So you’re saying he’s home-ophobic?”       ...

146,"I were going to work. But it's a good approximation of what my trip would be like. But what would it cost me if I drove the same distance? Kinda hard to say specifically but I put it as ¼ of a tank of gas (or $9.00) and approximately 1½ hours and on a good traffic day. I didn't want to figure in wear on my truck but it's definitely a consideration.  Well it seems obvious doesn't it? But just hold on a minute Joey. There are a couple of factors that I need to consider. I'm not the type of person that likes driving everywhere. In fact giving the option of driving someplace quickly or taking pub-trans and a bit more time, I'll usually opt for jumping on a bus. I like to read, people watch, and generally slack off mentally when I travel. But the difference in cost and time is pretty significant here, right? Well not necessarily, if I buy monthly passes and take the bullet train then, I figured I could end up paying something like $5.00 and take approximately 2 hours on the trip. That's not too bad, eh? Now if I took the advice of a friend and bypass the Bus and Bart and drove from my neighborhood to one of the CalTrain stops and just traveled on the train, I could still spend less money not driving all the way and make the trip last almost as short as driving only. This makes the decision much harder. Hmmm, well I think I should at least give it a shot and see if I can make it work.</s>","system into Chris O'Donnell territory. And that's about as low as it's possible to slide. 'The Bourne Supremacy' is plotless, pointless, overlong and aside from nice shots in the action sequences devoid of anything worthwhile. It blew. In a way that I haven't had to watch a movie blow in a very long time.  Anyway, let's leave the negatives aside for now shall we? The positives were as follows:   The Music:  Picked up two CDs in Virgin for starters, a Yellowcard EP that's not bad and an Idlewild album that's not bad either and is in fact brilliant in places, most obviously on the top class 'When I Argue I See Shapes' which I've listened to about 100 times since I got home. In fact I'm listening to it now. Yay. I mean, I've seen Idlewild a few times and enjoyed them but I never really noticed this. Next time. Speaking of music I can also confirm a title for the  My Pet Giraffe   demo/EP thingy. It's gonna be called 'Invisible Wounds'. Which brings me rather nicely to the second positive thing...    The Girl:  The girl then, who regular readers may recall answers to the name of Kitt, was of course the reason for the whole trip. And while I'm wary of saying too much because she'll be reading this and I don't really wanna embarrass either of us! (actually she just texted to basically just get me to hurry up and finish). Alright then, here goes... Kitt is great. She's fun, she's sweet, she's got a nice American accent that occasionally slips into an Irish one and though I may later regret admitting this on so public a forum she's really, really pretty too. I am really glad that I met her, though she's the first American I've met who's grasped sarcasm and man is she able to use it! We didn't do anything huge, just got some food (well ok, I ate), bought some CDs, hung about a bit in the park and went to that horrible film (I'm really glad I paid for her now because I'd feel guilty as hell now!). I had fun, I think she did (though she was knackered so it was hard to tell :-p) and we've agreed to do it again. And she's even texted me since so she means it too. I think.

What, indeed, are we to make of a war which is turned into a fantasy by those who started it? As foreign workers pour out of Iraq for fear of their lives, US Secretary of State Colin Powell tells a press conference that hostage-taking is having an 'effect' on reconstruction. Effect! Oil pipeline explosions are now as regular as power cuts. In parts of Baghdad now, they have only four hours of electricity a day; the streets swarm with foreign mercenaries, guns poking from windows, shouting abusively at Iraqis who don't clear the way for them. This is the'safer' Iraq which Mr Blair was boasting of the other day. What world does the British Government exist in? Take the Saddam trial. The entire Arab press - including the Baghdad papers - prints the judge's name. Indeed, the same judge has given interviews about his charges of murder against Muqtada Sadr. He has posed for newspaper pictures. But when I mention his name in The Independent, I was solemnly censured by the British Government's spokesman. Salem Chalabi threatened to prosecute me. So let me get this right. We illegally invade Iraq. We kill up to 11,000 Iraqis. And Mr Chalabi, appointed by the Americans, says I'm guilty of 'incitement to murder.'

More importantly 'Autograph' - the title mystified me. Wasn't it apt to name it 'Autobiograph(y)'.

The first reaction seems to be one of anger.  Fights have broken out over this movie, and I'm not talking little fights.  I'm talking knife, gun, baseball bat and scissor involving fights.  The people involved in these fights are not just trailer dwelling, on Cops 5 times last week for domestic violence, always getting into trouble sort of people.  So, what gives?  What is making these people think it would be a good idea to shove scissors through hands?  The second reaction is one of repentance.

Sure, you probably wouldn't make a very good bouncer, but that's okay. Take comfort from the fact that, overall, we think you're just swell.  We're not going to say you're a bad person, but you're toeing the line. A little advice: Try to think about how your victim will feel before you pull your next dirty prank (we don't care how funny it is when you take out a classifed ad and sell someone's car for them). You may think cruelty is funny, but your friends don't � especially the ones who've been burned by your verging-on-evil ways. Listen to your conscience a little more, okay?<\s>Your destiny is to be a Provider   Whether you know it or not, this is the role that is most in tune with who you are at your core. As a Provider, you have a genuine nurturing concern for the welfare of others and you're eager to serve them. You can recognize exactly what people need and your friendly, helpful, social nature makes them feel comforted. With your kind and generous heart, you are personable, talkative, and outward with your emotions, and your openness and sensitivity makes you concerned about the way others view you. Along these lines, be careful not to blame yourself when things go wrong. You cannot prevent bad things from happening, even though your tendency to be orderly with a strong sense of right and wrong may lead you to believe you can. Accept that you do what you can to take care of things and that this will get you far in the world.<\s>Your song is Walking On Sunshine  Your upbeat approach to life makes 'Walking on Sunshine' the perfect anthem for you.

This happy, horn-driven tune carries you to work every day. And even in those brief lapses when you're not fully on your game, 'Walking On Sunshine' seems to put things in perspective and get you back to your super groove. 'And don't it feel good?'

If you've had a long distance relationship before, you know better than I do the impact it has. I have a friend who lives in San Francisco and who's partner lives in Connecticut. For the last 5 years, they've seen each other on weekends and for longer periods when they can. They've managed to maintain a tight, monogamous relationship. That's one example of some I'm aware of.  I'm more uncertain about it. A lot of questions go through my mind. The biggest ones are these: how does a relationship grow when you see each other only on Saturday and Sunday?

Dave and I had had a long discussion the night before about the bombing of the World Trade Center. We'd used Google to look up articles on the rebuilding after the bombing. We had discussed how the bombing was more damaging to the structure of the towers than first realized. We speculated about what might have happened if they had collapsed.

Murder was silent as usual for a minute, but then he spoke up.  'I understand.  I have to go back to my band as well.'       The only time anyone really heard Murder's voice was when he was screaming into the microphone.  Murder almost never spoke in conversation, but when Scott heard him speak, his voice sounded familiar.  'Rivers? Is that you?,' Scott asked, 'What are you doing here?'       Murder removed his wig of long, black hair and took off his clip-on piercings.  'Yeah.  It's me,' he said, 'I just wanted to rock out.  Besides, I thought I told you never to start a side project.'  Scott, out of patience at that point, was about ready to pound him, but then Rivers said, 'I'm just fucking with you.  Relax.  I'll let you have this side band as long as you tell no one about my alter ego.'       'Man, I still can't believe you're Murder.  Are those tatoos for real?,' Scott asked.       'No.  They rub right off.  See?,' Rivers said rubbing his arm.  'Do we have a deal, Scott?  Can I secretly be a metal god and you have a side band.'       'Okay,' Scott replied, 'but on one condition.  You remember that this is MY band.  Don't you dare try to take over.  I'll let you do whatever the hell you want with Weezer as long as you let me do whatever the hell I want with this band.'       Rivers thought for a moment.  'Deal,' he said, shaking Scott's hand.       Later on, the band found a new drummer who was even more hardcore than the first.  His name was Joe and he had no qualms about Weezer or the fact that this band was just a side project.  In fact, Joe had a job of his own, so it worked out better that way for him.","say that made me happy even though it sounds incredibly nerdy but my rank changed again at the Space Twins messageboards.

And they present the authors' familiar, likable leading men, heroes who hail from New Orleans (Mr. Burke's Dave Robicheaux) and Arkansas (Mr. Hunter's Earl Swagger, who winds up in Cuba).   In these energetic, atmospheric Southern-based, thrillers, three ingredients are indispensable. The hero must be a brooding onetime alcoholic. He must have pain in his past.

Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company   urlLink Books of The Times: Hows That New Best Seller? Well, the Authors Famous<\s>I received this in an email - it was labeled as being from the Wall Street Journal, but I could not confirm that.  It is an interesting piece, however:   November 6, 2003  Recipe for a Bestseller: Baked Fudge and Author Charm  By JOANNE KAUFMAN  New York  Hyperion was reasonably certain it had caught lightning in a bottle when it  acquired 'PS, I Love You,' a first novel about a woman coping, through a series  of letters, with the untimely death of her husband. Rights to the book were  swiftly sold to 14 countries -- and Hollywood. The author, Cecilia Ahern, was  young (22), pretty, well-spoken and, by the way, the daughter of Bertie Ahern,  prime minister of Ireland. 'We believed she was someone who could break out,'  says Ellen Archer, Hyperion's vice president and publisher. Thus, the decision  was made to send Ms. Ahern on a six-city tour five months before the novel's  February 2004 publication, to chat up and charm bookstore buyers and owners at  specially arranged dinners, in the process perhaps convincing them to up  their orders for the book. 'They loved her,' adds Ms. Archer, 'and yes, they  wanted more copies.'  For decades, the author tour has been one of the key weapons in a publisher's  arsenal. The book comes out and the writer is dispatched to selected cities  for interviews, for readings, book signings and meet-and-greets with would-be  readers.  But over the past several years, many publishers have chosen not to wait  until a book is","kind an efficient way.  So, in that, I am blessed.

Sis took him and decided to just have me watch the other while she was out, which basically meant sit on the couch while he runs around the living room playing with a hundred toys.  Yeah, no needles.  I had a new piano student today.  Five years old and scared to death of someone new.  She clung to her mother for the first few minutes without aking a sound and refused to even touch the piano.  For a minute I thought she would simply refuse altogether and her mother would take her away upset that she wouldn't even try, but I knew I couldn't give up and I also knew no child can resist the charm of yours truly.  Sure enough, within five minutes I had her playing all the notes on the piano with the right fingers and laughing like we were at an amusement park.  Kids rock.  So, I'm flying through the last bit of the book, and it is becoming increasingly different from the movie.  I have 84 pages to go, and I don't see any way there can be any kind of simile between the two endings.  I'm still not certain which I will like better in the end, but I'm still hanging on to the movie side for now.  However, I can't seem to see the two characters as anyone other than Matt Damon and Will Smith even though I know they are truly nothing alike.  Had I read the book before I had seen the movie, I'm sure it would have been much darker for me.  But I still see Will Smith and the demeanor he portrayed, which is by far more comforting than the book illustrates with its details.  There's just something about a facial expression one sees that can't be written on pages, or at least I have yet to read.<\s>My little nephew gets his allergy test shots around 2:00 PM, and I get to be the bad guy to hold him down for it.

However, I just don't want her to overhear any Matt Belding jokes because that would be bad. And I know some might happen, because they always seem to do. She must not know about that. That reminds me...I am so tempted to tell her that I watched The Exorcist. I really wonder what she would do. Maybe I'll wait a few weeks, but I know that I eventually will tell her. I figure that if I wait a few weeks I can't get in trouble, because obviously I'm fine after seeing it. Oh well. I don't know. I just think it would be funny seeing her reaction. I really wonder what she would do.  Tommy right now is telling me how there are many sides to him, but I think he is full of crap. Oh well. And I just asked him to","today, and he'll be gone tomorrow too for FBLA. Hmm....what else? Oh yeah, I realized today that the reason Ryan sometimes aggravates me and stuff is becuase I find him to be a boring person. haha. Hopefully, he'll never come across this, but if he does, then I'm sorry. It's just how I feel right now. So yeah. That was really about it. So, how about them Blazers?<\s>Today has been a slow/fast day. Fast because of the stupid time change, and slow because I've done nothing. I watched the movie Gothika and that was about it. People said it was scary, but I didn't really think so. It was pretty good, but the ending was somewhat stupid. Oh well. I talked to Holli for a long while on the phone too. We talked about prom and our boy troubles...haha. Good ol' girl stuff. I dunno, boys are confusing...let me tell ya! Well, maybe boys aren't confusing, girls just make them that way. I dunno. Oh well....no biggie. That was pretty much my day....boring.<\s>Last night was prom, and I had a good time.  I was so happy, they played my favorite love song of all time! Score! I dunno, as much fun as I had, it kind of felt like something was missing. Dammit, I hate the feeling of emptiness and not knowing why I have it. Don't get me wrong, I still had a really good time tho. The limo ride was funny. On the way there, I sat between Ben and Ryan. When the limo did certain turns or something, I would kind of slide towards Ben. It was funny. On the way back, I sat between Scott and Ryan, and I would slide towards Scott. It was funny to me anyways. I dunno. Amanda and Holli kept joking around that I was hitting on their dates. At least I think they were joking. haha. I'm not sure. I wasn't hitting on their dates tho. So, I'm pretty sure that they were joking. Geez! This is so confusing. The more I think back to prom, the more I can't get over the fact of my empty feeling. I think it has something to do with the fact that I went with Ryan. Ryan is a great guy, but I kind of wished that I went with someone I liked.",blog_18864,blog_18864,True

162,"with the Catholic church. First of all, there is no such thing as 'pro-abortion'. The correct term is pro-choice, because that is exactly what it is: a choice. No one is dragging women by the hair into clinics to force them to terminate a pregnancy, but we've certainly seen pro-'lifers' trying to prevent women from making their own decisions. Seems the word life in that term only applies to the fetus, and not to the woman carrying it.  Secondly, the Catholic church has a lot of work to do on itself before it purports to know what is good for anyone. This whole communion issue is a partisan witch hunt designed to make Democrats look bad. During the last governor's election in Michigan, pro-'life' Catholics actually picketed outside of churches on Sundays to bring attention to the fact that Jennifer Granholm is a Catholic and pro-choice. Luckily, their strong arm tactics did not work--she won handily. Let's not forget, the people in charge of this witch hunt belong to the same organization that turned a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children that went on for many years. Not only a blind eye, but they created a safety net for abusive priests, many of whom never were or never will be punished.   Thirdly, I know a great number of Catholics that are sterilized, using birth control, had children out of wedlock, etc, that attend church every Sunday and take communion. Are they going to start handing out a questionnaire about your personal life before they distribute the Eucharist? They may be surprised to find that no one, no matter what political coat they wear, is really 'able' to partake in this ritual.  Lastly, let us not forget that one of the Ten Commandments plainly states: Thou Shalt Not Kill. Wenski fails to mention that the church should be denying communion to Jeb Bush as well if they are going to play this game fairly. The hypocrisy of the Catholic church is staggering.  If the point of religion and the act of going to church is designed to bring one closer to holiness, as Wenski says, why deny someone's closeness to god simply because they aren't perfect? I wasn't aware that perfection was a prerequisite to enter a church. I thought the church accepted anyone, anytime, for any reason. Apparently, there is no sanctuary for one who does not live up to the church's standards, or follow every one of their rules, all of the time.","had more guts than I do when it comes to color.

165,"the database server is restarted, so RAID 0 is a possibility for tempdb on production SQL server computers. RAID 0 provides the best RAID performance for the tempdb database with the least physical drives. The concern with using RAID 0 for tempdb in a production environment is that SQL Server must be stopped and restarted if physical drive failure occurs in the RAID 0 array and this does not necessarily occur if tempdb is placed on a RAID 1 or 0+1 array. To move the tempdb database, use the ALTER DATABASE command to change the physical file location of the SQL Server logical file name associated with the tempdb database. For example, to move the tempdb database and its associated log to the new file locations E:\Mssql and C:\Temp, use these commands: alter database tempdb modify file (name='tempdev',filename= 'e:\mssql\tempnew_location.mDF') alter database tempdb modify file (name='templog',filename= 'c:\temp\tempnew_loglocation.LDF') The master, msdb, and model databases are not used much during production compared to user databases, so thay are not typically a consideration in I/O performance tuning. The master database is used only for adding new logins, databases, and other system objects. Nonclustered indexes reside in B-tree structures that can be separated from their related database tables with the ALTER DATABASE statement. In this example, the first ALTER DATABASE creates a filegroup. The second ALTER DATABASE creates a file with a separate physical location associated with the filegroup. At this point, indexes can be created on the filegroup as illustrated by creating the index called index1. The sp_helpfile stored procedure reports files and filegroups present for a given database. The sp_help tablename has a section in its output that provides information about the table indexes and filegroup relationships. alter database testdb add filegroup testgroup1 alter database testdb add file (name = 'testfile',  filename = 'e:\mssql\test1.ndf') to filegroup testgroup1 create table test1(col1 char(8)) create index index1 on test1(col1) on testgroup1  sp_helpfile sp_help test1 For more information, see these topics and/or keywords in SQL Server  Books Online: ALTER DATAB","numerous documents that should be read to fully understand MOF and its related Frameworks, and a summary has been provided in the next section.

Here we are talking of knowledge and Skill Set domains, which can be of effective role while planning for capacity management. They are as follows: -   (A)Network domain administrator: - He should have the perspective of network bandwidth and when application is online how much congestion it can create. Also for the ports and other network issues related.  (B)Vendor Representative: - you must get the critical technical know how about the hardware supplied by your vendor. It is not the matter of financial perspective only but from the performance/scaling/reliability perspective as well. One must get the docs for best practices involved with the respective Hardware.  (C)Application Developer: - They are the people from whom any change in the application scenario will come.So interaction with them is critical. Any change in Data access or Database schema has to be logged and carefully analyzed for performance and other side effected.   3.

I attended my last lecture as an undergraduate student (for the record, it was DTSP, of which I understoof little).  I can't even understand what this means, having finished school.  Sure, I still have a few reports to hand in, and 2 finals, but wow!  Never to attend a lecture.  Nice.  And as a bonus surprise, I got a call yesterday for an interview at SNC for a summer position.  Sure, it's nothing permanent, but it'll be good experience.  The interview went well.  The lady asked me a few questions and made sure I know how to write and speak and generally found out if I was interested.  She eventually said I'm an excellent candidate for the position and she'll find out next week what happens.  The position would be technical writing, more specifically, writing the help files for their in-house project management software, or something.  Let's see what becomes of this.<\s>Aha!!  Today, the Expos start the season!!  Excellent....let's go!  Skimming through my regular blogs (by my fellow ECE students), there is a feeling of sadness going around.  People are getting sentimental about this being the last week.  I didn't even realize.  Thursday marks my last undergraduate lecture (I hope).  I suppose it is sad.  But it's not the same since we moved to Trottier.  Back in McConnell, we used to hang in McC12, eating lunch and stuff.  Sure, Trottier has the Halo lab, but it's not the same.  Remember in PErfect Strangers, when they moved from the apartment to the house?  It wasn't the same after that.  Same thing.  Anyway, no time to think about stuff.  Too many things this week to realize what's going on.<\s>Well, this coming week will be nutty.  Comp arc presentation.  Lab demo x2.  Quizzes, etc.  Argh!  So with all this stuff, I'm naturally looking forward to my Sunday night tv lineup.  But alas, everything is a repeat (except for Arrested Development, hooray!).  I heard the The Simpsons was",".  I went to the dentist today.  For years, the guy's been saying that he'll keep an eye out for these little dots of cavities.  This yeah, same story.  He said I could maybe get a filling for it.  Or not.  As long as we keep an eye on it.  Meh, whatever.  Ok, I'm out dawgs.  Word up!  And the Froo-Froo B*tch-Dawgs rule!<\s>Alright, I admit it.  I'm buying McDonald's hockey cards this year.  I got one with a piece of net mesh insode the card.  How cool is that!  These cards are very well done this year.  I urge everyone to buy them (mainly so that I can trade with you).  Other than that, I gotta start studying for finals now!  Argh!  The humanity.  But there are so many more important things to do...like watch the extras on the Two Towers Extended Edition DVD.   Ahhh...I love DVDs.  Anyone else watch 'Arrested Development' on Fox?  I must say that it is one of the funniest shows on tv now.  It's quickly climbing the ranks.  It's on after Malcolm in the Middle on FOX, Sundays at 9:30.  WATCH IT!  Yesterday's episode was particularly amazing.  Let's hope FOX has patience with this excellent show because they rarely show patience with others (ahem, Andy Richter).  Alrighty, I'm out.  BTW, the official soundtrack of this entry is the voice of Joe 'Greasy' Greiss asking questions about how to finish the Computer Graphics report.

I made a new compilation mp3 CD with the 3 disc Johnny Cash download, all 4 White Stripes albums, the 2 Strokes albums, Sam Roberts and The Raveonettes.  I really like the Raveonettes.

I made 25+ CD mixes in honor of him, passed them out at times (I'm not lying).  My Door (work of, ahem, art) has puppy pics of him.  Back before he was sick, when he still looked like a Min Pin.

I'm sad, yes, but he's alive and well and it really isn't the same as  really  losing him.  Break-ups are hard, but you have the chance to say 'I'm sorry' later on.  Death is not that forgiving.  Isn't it funny and strange that the things that piss us off about someone are the very things we remember and immortalize when they are gone?

Good","beginning the next day as the last one ended, in a cleansing bath of quiet, fiery streaks of sun  Jude stood next to his old beat-up Chevy pickup. It had just broken down and he stood with his hands on his waist, looking down on the town from a hill several miles away.  Smoke rose up from the propped-open hood of the truck and whipped and curled around in the quiet shifting wind.    He snatched a Polaroid camera from the cab, walked down the shoulder away from the truck, and aimed it at the town.  Click.  Like a fortune-telling machine at a carnival, the camera produced a white square. Jude pulled it out and fanned in the air, looking out over the scene he had just captured.  The tiny buildings and streets wrapped in gold began to materialize in the photograph and Jude walked back to the truck.  It wasnt starting last night at a truck stop so he had stayed the night in the cab hoping for a better tomorrow.  And fortunately it started but now he found himself in a worse predicament.  It had died on him as he was driving down the hill and would only concede a clicking noise at the turn of the key.  Worse, Jude didnt know a thing about cars or engines or anything like that.  So he stood there prodding at parts, even though he had no idea what they did.  Breaking down didnt concern Jude; it was what it would cost that worried him.  That aside, he saw this trip as an adventure anyways.  He was traveling from Texas to Portland, Oregon to move in with his uncle and go to school there.  His mother had finally married a man who wasnt Judes father and he found it too strange to stay and much more exciting to move to Oregon.    So there he was.  With no idea of what was wrong with his truck or even if there would be a place to fix it there.  The way it was all set on fire by the glow of the sun made the town very inviting though, thought Jude.  So he slammed the hood shut and reached into the cab for his backpack and a couple of other things and locking the door, more out of habit than need, he began to walk towards the town on the shoulder of the road.  The gravel crunched under Judes shoes as he made his way down the curves of the hill.  Jude was a fairly tall, thin 19-year old.  His dark",blog_5796,blog_2617,False

Tomes of unspoken power, bound with all sorts of hide, even human, adorned the rows upon rows of shelves that lined the circular room. The shelves were a wonder by themselves, their exquisite workmanship evident in the failing light, where magical designs prevented the wrong hands from getting to the shelves without permission. All that, and much more, had been acquired during the great mage’s adventuring days. Now he lived sequestered deep in his tower where young aspiring magi came for tutelage. Powerful magics had been drawn in the construction of the tower, for the blocks of black granite that had been hewn from the mountain face of the Daishain Mountains a thousand miles away had been carried with an unerring precision that outdid any mortal’s work, as arcane glyphs and sigils engraved upon the impregnable stone walls interweaved and twined together, forming intricate designs that defied the eye, making even the finest lace seem drab. Even a century after its construction, the tower still prickled with fey energies from the residue of its making.  The man focused his eyes, the yellow gleam still undiminished with age, upon the bits of parchment that still danced their message. His initial irritation was soon smoothed over as the message unfurled its contents. The frown dissipated, leaving only the wrinkles of age, as his facial muscles twitched in a smile. Excitement added its own gleam to the magical yellowness in his eyes, an emotion so seldom associated with the man even in his younger days, but he could have been a different man then, as he nodded his head in what seemed like agreement.  As the final word played itself out, the man threw his head back and roared in maniacal laughter, the sound traveling through the entrance to his study, past the enchanted arch that served as the trans-dimensional walkway, bouncing off the walls yet never reducing its magnitude, where startled servants dropped pots and apprentices glanced out their quarters cautiously, wondering what monster had been the source of that laugh. Other acclaimed wizards looked in the direction of the laughter with puzzled expressions, wondering if he had finally gone mad, although that could not have been technically true as he was already half mad at best.<\s>I swear that from this day onwards I shall treat my blog like a revered god, for providing me with the privilege of using it as an alternative form of communication.",blog_1555,blog_17456,False

I felt that I was led on, and that in one week she basically told me that she was not ready for a commitment, and that I have lied to her time and time again.  That is why I got so pissed off and acted hastily, broke the window (which on my part was wrong) and royally fucked life up as i know it.  Did i have any right to say what i said? or was it just 'emotional Blackmale' as she love to say?     So now it's all over, the dream i once dreamt is now shatered...with nothing but memories remaining.

It has taken me a while to come to this conclusion...but my life just keeps on getting more boring.  I find myself being stuck at home and typing on the computer. Not a life that i once imagened... Well i know one thing, I have figured out that i'm going to do something with my life, i just haven't figured out what that is yet?  Over the past week i have been form a couple of job interviews, payed the rent and payed to get the phone reconected.  money is a little tight at the moment if you hadn't of geussed. I find myself counting every cent that i have...and not eating because i cannot afford to.   And the beat goes on... I acctually do have some good news.  My puppies are no longer getign out...it has been nearly two weeks and they have tried countless times, but to my surprise they are still locked up in there yard where they are ment to be.   The wedding plans are going good and my partner and I are trying to decided on the flowers...and of course the date... We don't know when it will be yet, proberbably about 4th December 2005. I'm looking forward to it. (But don't tell my partner).  She has a new hobbie now...we are going into bird breeding, which i hate. Well hate it such a strong word...i have always had a fear of birds and it has taken me about foru months to get used to Lucky (the pet Budgie)...","got out and nearly got shot.  Where to start? Yesterday morning after a long night on the Dope (figure of speech)...i was awoken to a person who was our next door neighboure...who i had never meet before...well it seems that my two dogs have been getting out for the past couple of week and annoying his cattle... Which is in there natural instinc. Well to my surprise he told me 'lock them up, or by the end of the day...or i will shoot them'. I was quit angry...so i have spent the past two days locking them up... If he shoots my dogs i will shoot his cattle.  All this happend after i had a car accident, i backed into a tree and smashed the car...they say things happen in threes...well here is the third. My partner was recently given a job at Telstra..weel she was over the moon..and so was I...well i day before she started the rang her up at!0pm...and said to her that the position she had applyed for was no longer avalable....and this was done after she had signed an employement contract. So i thought i would take them to court....well it seems that this lovely phone company has screwed us over again...she has no legal rights to them doing this... So now we are back to square one, she has no job and the bastards always seem to get away with shit like this.  Well seeming that it's past 4am i better be off....hope you had a good read and i'll be updating this more regulary from now on.<\s>When life becomes shit, you become insane.  I was told this by a very wise man once and never took him to seriously. Well after the past week i believe it more than i belive the stars shine at night and the sky is blue.  Over the past two months my partner has been telling me she wants to have my kids. So we made a decision together for her to go off the pill, And low and behold...she fell pregnant. Well After that shit hit the fan. She said that we would make a decision together. Well that didn't happen. One night I was walking through the bath room and she told me to sit down because we needed to talk.  She said that in all reality we could not afford a kid so she was having an abortion.

Anyway, we went there and I tried on four pairs of pants all of which were totally different styles and none of them fit me right. I think I gained weight in some wierd place because they felt really odd. You know how sometimes the pants are tighter in some places than in others? Well they were all like that on me! I also tried on a few pairs at American Eagle. It was really wierd because I tried on long sized pants and they were barely long enough. It like their long sizes aren't really long. Oh well. Anyway, I still need to buy pants and that was really what I was going for today and I didn't even buy one pair. I did buy a really cute jacket from Abercrombie though. It's a short trench and it's like a cotton candy pink and I am in love with it. I also bought a coral colored sweater that goes off the shoulder. God I love shopping.

I call her that sometimes but not as much as Kitty. Recently she has become more of an outside cat so I don't see her that often especially because I've been at my dads a lot lately. Today when Sarah was still over I saw her for the first time in a week or so. I picked her up but she didn't really seem like she wanted to be held, so I held her front legs together and petted her stomache like I do a lot of the times, she usually stays in my lap or arms, but this time she really wanted to get away and I didn't know why until Sarah pointed out that she was bleeding. I didn't think it was a big deal at first but of course I wanted to look at it. There was a nickel sized hole in her back left leg where there was absolutely no skin at all. I could see her muscle and a vein just sitting there exposed. She wanted to go outside so badly but I was so freaked out of course she was not going outside",blog_12050,blog_999,False

And I got my answer some 2 weeks later in a rendering explosion of metal and glass smashing the person I used to be surely to death as its never come back. I know what it is that leaves. Words can't be spoken for a powerful feeling. But its been years that I have been trapped here..in between. Sometimes seeming all the world alive..sometimes a ghost of something that was all wrapped up into one.  I miss Kevin so. I feel him around me at all times...like now, whne the traffic is gone, the lights out around the area and its quiet enough to feel him here. I tried to say goodbye to all them to not trap them here by my pain of losing them. I lit candles and burned them all evening...each one was a friend..Kevin, Tina...Steve. I thought, in the morning I had let them go...but there is more- something primordal and ancient that still is here. I am not scared by it anymore- I accept it. Somehow. If I am to feel it, then its meant to be.  Tonight I wonder if it is myself who is trapped..and that THEY are trying to HELP me reach wherever they are. I'm not in the mind of suicide. I am in the mind of wonderment at the way it all works. Just how have I made it so long..or have I?  I always swore to myself I'd be dead by 27 for some reason. I wasn't..but my wreck was when I was 28..and it took some long years to understand that I had died..for I was not as I had ever been.

We had to, sorrowfully. I caught up on the competition a bit and saw Brittany. It was nice to see her, and lucky for me she agrees with my being with Tycho and he thinks that she is a cool person. That is a step up from the days of old in itself too.   I could not help but think back to Frontiers a lot of the time there. I grew up since then. I can feel it. I thought of sitting on that bench hoping that someone would come and talk to me...like I used to do before I became as social as I am. I remember kicking myself in the ass because that was not how I wanted to act. I wanted to be known as a very social person, and that was not the way to do it. I was supposed to go find people, get along with them, and have a great time. Once robotics came around I did more of that. Other than my team in that competition, I really just did not mix well with the other students there. The PAs yeah, they were great, and I talk to them more than any of the residents next to Brandon. I seem to actually do that a lot too. I guess I am just more used to people that are older than me. Mostly what I thought of though, was again being on that bench waiting for someone to talk to me. Matt usually asked if I was okay, and if I was sure. I would just say that I was, because I basically was. I just reacted very poorly. I know if I were there now I most certainly would not have done the same things. I would be the way I would have liked to if I was. When no one did talk to me it was the dismay and depression that set in. I felt that I was unaccepted there, and that just seemed to confirm it. I was very self-conscious and almost self loathing. I was amazed that I did not cut myself when I was there. I just wanted to sit alone, and be alone until the end of the trip. I opened up to my team and Lisa by the end and became more myself.

K, well throughout the night, we were hanging out with a couple friends, Nellie and Kong (sp?), and I guess they were accompanied by another dude--Charles, I think his name was.  Well, I was pretty freakin wasted myself, but from the flashes I remember.. hmm, well I don't even really know the beginning/middle/end, so let me just say what I remember.  I remember talking with the guy, then kissing him (yuuuuuuck!!! I dunno how the FUCK that happened!  Would I have agreed to something like that?!  I've been drunk before and that has NEVER happened.) And all of a sudden his hands were hella up my shirt, and I remember sobering up real quick after that, so I'm pretty sure his hands were hella groping (it takes alot for me to get offended, ask anyone).  The thing is, I didn't get mad, I just helllllllllla pulled away/pushed him away, and told him I needed to check on Jes.  AHHHHHHH why am I so frickin NICE?!..and then I thought about it and ILL!  What an ASSHOLE!!  There's no way I'd be leading this little shit on, especially after I saw how UNattractive he was (let's not forget to point out the fact that I was at a DOWN club.. uh to check out the ladies?!).

I know, I know, I'm being mean and I'm usually not (I swear!), but in this case, he deserves to be called UGLY. =P  So anyway, I feel he  completely  took advantage of me / the situation.  It sucks because I hella thought he was cool when we were talking; he was talking about taking care of Jes..

I'm excited that it's going to be emmy's bday and a whole buncha peoples will be here.  well.. ok, maybe not a whole buncha peoples, but i'm looking forward to my uncle's cooking! =D  hopefully elman and joy won't flake since I didn't get the chance to see them today. =T  it occurred to me that I haven't really been single SINGLE for any valentine's days since.. ohh.. I was fifteen or so.  CRAZINESS isn't it???  lucky me?  i don't know.  anyway, I'm looking forward to spending some QT with my woman.. I think we're going to chill at her place.  Oh and I lost a bet so it looks like I'm going to be in charge of dinner.. coooooL ;) ..but it doesn't really matter what we do, I enjoy her company regardless.    BTW, the orientation for the egg donation went GREAT.  Melodie, the director, ended up talking with me one-on-one since the others were running late, and she was really thorough.  I  do  have a couple of questions/concerns after the fact, but that's just because I think I was excited because 1.) the W hotel is a tiiiiight hotel--I'm going to stay here one day with the weekday gf ;) 2.) everything was sooo nice and I felt a little intimidated 3.) the more I thought about  why  I was there, the more anxious I was.  But that's okay because I can always email her with my concerns.  Anyway, who knew it was such a lengthy process???  First is the consultation (check), second is the psychological eval, third is the legal consultation, fourth is the medical examination, fifth is synchronization, and finally is the treatment (shots that I'm supposed to inject into myself).

At least a girl can dream.<\s>Why Throwing Away Expectations (Usually) Is a Good Idea...   1)  Free to blog my little heart out and not give a damn about what folks think or shout out  (even though secretly I love that feedback tool so much I think I was basing later enteries on my ego and less on the truth).  2)  Today I went home for lunch and took off my pants and ate my Cream of Wheat with brown sugar and Brummel & Brown in my knee socks and top.  I wasn't doing this to be sexy or crazy. My pants are full of static electricity and I was wearing high heels and I hate high heels. They'll never feel comfortable to me, kind of like thongs. Ugh. You can't eat lunch without pants at work, and so I was happy to be home. If I did declare Tuesdays pantless lunch day, I might make no one happy because I hate shaving, especially my bikini line. I am disgusting and hairy and daring. Get used to it.   3)  You have more fun and more joy in moments where you do as The Beatles would do: Let it be! WWTBD?  Let it be. Let me say it again: LET IT BE. I thought about this today at the stoplight. If I were to get a vanity license plate, what would it say? Something about being or loving or niceness. I'm mean and angry somedays, but I'd like to focus on the cooler parts of Kella.   4)  Listening to country music is about not having expectations.  It's about accepting boot-scooting good times and the Chattahoochee River and crying in your beer.  If you get over the extreme sentimentality of the stuff, it'll become bearable, even enjoyable.  I used to make fun of those who listened to this crap. Now I love this crap and plan on going to Nashville after Tucson to try my hand at songwriting. Why not?

It was in a proper rural setting. We saw many people doing pujas etc. We went to a secluded place and sat for sometime. The river at that part was not very clean and also deep. So nobody ventured into the water.  By noon we were hungry and went in search of food. There was guy by a small roadside stall, who agreed to make rice and sambar if we wated 15 minutes. After about an hour, we got food served in plates made of dry leaves. We had a tough time controlling the watery sambar from flowing into our laps.  We walked to another part of the river after the lunch. We heard people talking about two guys who drowned an hour ago. I went and asked a decent looking person, as to what had happened. He explained to me that there was a drowning incident before their very eyes and that the police has been called. He was a college lecturer and had come with his students on excursion. Hearing that I hailed from Kerala, he pointed to two of his students who were bathing in the river. I talked to them for some time and went back to my friends.

Religion in any form I believe is very evil in the end. I find them limiting and controlling.  Their intentions were correct but their means are a bit suspect. Who is anyone to tell me what the exact road to 'heaven' is.   I have read books by Steven Covey (where I was able to really get the nature of unconditional love) and many of the'spiritual' authors.  It will be many many decades, possibly centuries before these views are globally adopted but I have great hope that this is the direction we are going.  I can't help but feel that separating church from state is a very good thing and a great start towards a completely peaceful world. For me democracy's best cornerstone is the separating of church and state.  It is very brave of you to put yourself 'out there' and encourage feedback.

Cheers, Rachel<\s>Originally Written September, 2003 A bit of a synopsis of my life from the time I was about 27... a few struggles have been left out... but this is the gist of it. I was finally granted the gift of being free and clear of my debt. This was a rough copy and I did end up sending in a much better version but I can't find it right now. It still hurts at times to read about my life.  I have grown but let's just say that being born into a violent and extremely dysfunctional family has nearly killed me. Quite literally. By not only my so called 'father's' hand but my own. An abusive childhood still sneaks up on me and robs me of the joy of life. I am growing but the horrors still manage to present themselves.  I can remember being ten years old and learning about suicide. I was so elated by it. My life at ten was so horrible and when I realized that there was a way out I was so entirely relieved. It helped me cope with the horrors. If it got too bad I didn't have to stay I could leave. I imagined the peace of the 'nothingness' of death and it would seem a great relief from the pain I was experiencing. From that day on I have held suicide","class ended, but did manage to find work at first for two weeks (AeroInfo) and then I was renewed every two weeks for 8 months and was then sent home again as they ran out of money. After being unemployed for another 3 months I was asked back by AeroInfo. They kept me on 3 month contracts for 9 months and then finally hired me full-time with a warning that they thought the job would only last two years. I was finally getting on my feet and bought a car for the first time since I had been living in Vancouver. I needed the car for the job as I was required to use it for work. I had to pay cash as I have no credit. Unfortunately, the job only lasted one year. I remained unemployed for another year fighting another bout of depression. During this time was finally able to file bankruptcy and get the burden of this debt off of my shoulders. A burden that I woke up with every single morning for the past 12 years. I could have filed about 6 months sooner but I was so debilitated by the depression that looking for work was all I could handle. My psychiatrist urged me to file as the burden of this debt was a key factor in my illness.  For the first time in my life I have a full-time permanent job. I hope I pass the probation period at the end of October. I need to be able to save. I am 41 years old with no husband or children. I live alone, all I have is my dog. It is very hard for me to find places to rent with a dog. Many will do a credit check and I have lost many lower rent places because they would not rent to someone with bad credit. I want to move on to be free of this burden to have some money in the bank for emergencies.  I have not gone out and spent money foolishly on vacations, electronics, fancy dinners or clothes. I have never been fired, only laid off. I have been just getting buy at the poverty level for at least 8 of the past 10 years. My tax records will prove this. In the true spirit of the bankruptcy law as it was intended I feel I should finally be set free of this burden and allowed to move on with my life, not in another 12 months, but now. For the sake of my mental, spiritual, physical and financial health I urge you to not sentence me to one more year of waking up to the burden of this debt.</s>",blog_13769,blog_13769,True

Get the message to Rob and Gossett, that applies to Amber and me too.  Here's what you need to do:  1) Talk to Gossett and Rob about splitting a limo (remember this is April 17), and then book it.  We won't need a stretch probably, just one big enough to hold 6 people.  It needs to be at my house at 5:30.  Make sure the guys know that everyone is coming to my house beforehand, around 4:30 for people's parents to take pictures, etc.  Yall can just leave your cars here and then after prom the limo can bring us back and my mom will have a'midnight breakfast' thing fixed.  The girls will spend the night and the guys will leave about 2:00 or whenever yalls parents want you home.  2) Make reservations at Carrabba's for six people at 6:00.  That will give us about an hour and 45 minutes to eat, so we can leave about 7:45 and have about 20 minutes to get to the factory so we can make a fashionably late entrance (we don't want to be the first ones there).  3) Remember (and remind Rob and Gossett) to order (wrist corsages for everyone is best) corsages at least a week in advance.

For while the turkey is larger and stronger than the peacock, the turkey has an evolved mechanism for deciding conflicts bloodlessly, and the peacock has no such mechanism. The turkey struts up to wrestle, the peacock takes flight and attacks from above. The turkey, unable to cope with this unorthodox technique, lays his head on the ground in a submissive gesture. Were the other combatant another turkey, he would now be completely unable to attack, held back by thousands of years of evolution which demand that he spare the loser. The peacock, however, doesn't understand. He pecks and pecks and pecks. The turkey is driven by this into further submission, prevented from escaping by thousands of years of evolution. Only intervention by another species (most likely human) prevents the death of the turkey. So it is when humans cannot understand an appeal for mercy due to difference of language and/or custom.  Human beings build weapons with their brains, not of their bodies. Humans must, therefore, develop inhibitions based upon thought, not instinct, for our instincts are based upon a creature which has nothing but his bare hands to fight with. Instinctively, we are as doves who suddenly acquired the beaks of crows and the talons of eagles, and haven't the faintest idea of their own strength. If there is to be peace, it is based upon the mind, not the body. The “soft animal within” (which a minister I know refers to so lovingly) is a clumsy brute when the mind gives him weapons which surpass those of even the greatest of predators.  On to nuclear weapons. Up to this point, whatever the inhibitions of the individuals that make up a group, the group itself has few inhibitions against fighting to the death of the individual within. At its most bestial, such conflicts are rarely destructive to the group as a whole; the rules of victory and submission can generally regulate the outcome of such battles. Genocide is the product of the individual mind, the decision that such conflicts can be brought to an end forever by eliminating the other group. Otherwise, the interplay of bravado and fear can regulate such conflicts, though they be disastrous to the individuals involved.  However, now, we have weapons that frighten even the group mind: nuclear weapons. With one fell stroke,",blog_17103,blog_5939,False
185,"2, 2002  Straight people can get married. Gay people can't.  Both are humans and as thus are equal in the eyes of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Treating them like second class citizens is no better than saying something like 'Uppity Negroes have no right to touch our white women. Or vote.'  You silly Cro-Magnon prosophobes.    Sodomy is illegal.   If I could throw every sodomite in jail, I would be the first in line to serve my time.  And it would be a very,  very  long line.  Guess what, hetero nation!  Sodomy isn't just the buttsex between two men.  It is also any sort of oral or anal copulation at all, even between men AND women.  So, if gay people can't get married because of the possibility that they will sodomize each other (which, as a side note, is legislation based upon a potentiality, a lawmaking concept that no one in their right mind would agree to) then the logic stands that anyone who may sodomize each other can't get married at all.  So that means no more marriage.  And no more blow jobs.  And no more investigating the little man in the boat, if you know what I mean.  Although I guess people with no mouths or assholes could get married.  So there you have it.  No marriage for anyone that has a mouth or an asshole, and especially no marriage for anyone who has both.    Terrific Conclusion To This Awesome Report   To sum up, if gay people can get married they aren't going to force you or your kids to have sex with dogs.  Denying them the right to marry is treating them as inferior beings, lesser than their heterosexual counterparts.  All they want is the same rights that straight people have, and there is no good reason, legal or otherwise, that they should not have these rights.  All people in America supposedly have identical rights and opportunities.  I know this is bullshit, and you know this is bullshit, but we're talking about class warriorism when we say that, separating the wolves from the herd.  In the American lexicon of history, we have always been a self-correcting organism, always eventually recognizing our gross impropriety and fixing our blind, frantic mistakes to some extent or another.  The only problem with our current situation is that the blind","does this read?

Stay with me though, because this is where things get really good.    The targets, in addition to the financial institutions in New York, Washington and Newark, N.J., that have been the subject of public warnings, include such economic-related targets as oil and gas facilities with a view toward disrupting the November election.   'The goal of the next attack is twofold: to damage the U.S. economy and to undermine the U.S. election,' the official said. 'The view of al Qaeda is 'anybody but Bush.''   Bingo bango!  Really read what that sentence says, and how the math of it works out.  Go ahead.    Right.  What the official is saying here is that the undermining of the US election is equal to the concept of 'Anybody but Bush'; if Bush loses, the terrorists win!  If you've ever said you want 'Anybody but Bush' then you park your car in the same philosophical garage as the terrorists, you fucker!  Is it possible that our intrepid reporter took this official's comment out of context?  It certainly is!  So then who is at fault for this grammatical equation?       The officials also said the terrorist group has begun using female members for preattack surveillance and possibly as suicide bombers, thinking that women will have an easier time getting past security checkpoints at airports, borders and ports.   The al Qaeda attack plans call for bombings using trucks and cars, and hijacked aircraft, including commercial airliners and helicopters.

For those of us who live here, and for those of us who were raised in this great city...the time is now to take action! We have lived with our pervasive and stifling citywide low self-esteem for too long. The time is now to wrench away the slow, plodding, backwards conservatism that is clotting the arteries of this city's cultural and economic cardiovascular system. Are we a city of gray-haired ex-banking executives and sports team owners? Are we a city of doomsayers content to watch opportunity after opportunity slip away to other regions, states and countries?

Go ahead and move somewhere else...the rest of us don't have the time or energy to combat your negativism and doubt. Those of us who believe we can move this city forward must focus every bit of energy toward that goal. In the coming weeks and months, we must seize every opportunity to support Cleveland...in every decision large and small. We must keep industry, culture and housing both viable and attractive options. We have an overwhelming wealth of underutilized talent and capacity. We must keep work in our city.

With my free hand, I reached up and started gently twisting and squeezing her nipple while licking her clit again and still finger fucking her.

I slid my juice-covered fingers out from inside her and down to my own pussy, which had been nearly dripping all over the floor with excitement.  As I continued to tongue-flick her and roll her nipples, I slid my very slimy fingers up and down over my own clit and lips.  I did this for several moments until my fingers were completely drenched from my own flow of fun.  I switched hands and brought my soaked hand up to her mouth and pressed the tip of my index finger against her lips, tracing the contour of them.  She instinctively opened her mouth slightly, and I slipped two fingertips into her mouth.  She kept her eyes closed and started sucking and licking the juice from them, and made an 'Mmmmmm' sound.

I told her to turn sideways and lay down flat with her back on the bench, and not to be alarmed with my next move.  Her eyes widened again, as I crawled on top of her, sixty-nine style.  But she already knew what to do, and as I placed my cunt over her mouth, she attacked it, grabbing around my ass and pulling me down closer right on top of her face.

And the news was on, and it was about the Pope. This is where I concluded that there was a religious war. The Pope himself couldn't even go out in public without masses of people attempting to kill him. Neighbors were fighting neighbors. The streets were mass chaos. People had become barbaric. Then all of a sudden people started firing on the house I was at. They had more than guns, they had some pretty crazy weapons. I remember hearing my friend shout that it was a 'group of evangelists,' and when I somehow caught sight of them, I realized that I knew most of them; one, in fact, was my own father. Then as I looked outside at the street, I saw people running everywhere, frantically; everyone was just in this huge, chaotic state. And I realized that our society, and our civilization, was destroying itself. That evidentally people hadn't learned from the past, and I knew that everyone would eventually destroy everyone else. All civilizations come to their end, and I realized that that was the end of ours.  Yea, pretty depressing. Pretty strange, actually.

Clutching her handbag close to her chest with her white-gloved hands, she expresses her disbelief to her neighbor in a shocked whisper. “The creature was naked?” I hear Joe snickering in the background. “Nice dress.”  When the town meeting ends, a furious crowd led by the sheriff heads off in search of Bat Boy. With torches in hand and a song on their lips they set forth enthusiastically. “See him run through the swaaamps and the bogs, watch him feed on the fliiies and the frogs.” Their plan is to capture the creature and auction him off to the highest bidder. But when they reach the cave, Bat Boy is gone. As it happens, he was taken home by one of the teenagers who originally found him. Rather than attend the town meeting, she returned to the cave and gently lured Bat Boy home with her, where she hoped to civilize him.  When the girl--Shelley Parker--gets Bat Boy home, the family decides to adopt him.  Things get tricky when it is discovered that he can only survive by drinking blood-- but they persevere and manage to dress and civilize him anyway. By intermission, Bat Boy has dubbed himself Edgar and is flawlessly speaking the King’s English, cooking fabulous four-course meals and designing his own clothes.  He can arrange flowers and serve tea and is an accomplished ballroom dancer.   His genius and wit secure him the affection of Shelley and her entire family.  But the town sees things differently. They dislike Edgar despite his talents and decide that they must be rid of him. It is decided that Edgar should be dispatched to the nearest research facility. The Parker family fights to prove that Edgar is not a monster, and before long Shelley’s affection for Edgar becomes love.    A tryst is arranged in the forest just outside Hope Falls.  While the sun sets, Shelley and Edgar make love under the trees. The ground underneath them is strewn with wildflowers and autumn leaves of every color. The forest ‘creatures’--cast members with various stuffed animals strapped to their heads and belted around their waists--dance around the lovers while the forest god Pan watches over everything. “Hold","'ve wondered that myself, fervently, repeatedly--what the hell  is  the matter with me?

Well, that did not sit too well with voters in the Beaver State.  A ballot referendum was held last February. Oregon voters had a crystal clear choice: (1) agree to raise taxes on themselves, or (2) face 544 million dollars in budget cuts; including, $300 million in spending cuts for public school programs and nearly $200 million in spending cuts for public health care services.  No contest.  The voters rejected the tax increases...  urlLink by 20 percentage points!  'Liberal Oregon,' huh?   Missouri - Gay Marriage Referendum - August 2004     Ah, Missouri. One of the 'bitterly divided''swing states' over which the media keeps hyperventilating.  Last week, the Show Me State had their primary elections. And, furthermore, they were asked a question regarding gay marriage. The question was very simple: Do Missourians want to ban gay marriage or not ban it.  The voters responded: We want gay marriage banned. And they did so by a margin of  urlLink over 40 percentage points!  Hmm.  Four separate ballot measures. Three separate issues. Three distinct states; two of which are allegedly 'liberal.' Four separate election cycles. Spanning the course of 10 years. But all within the past 10 years.

I had never joined a church in my life. I had asked Christ to be my savior as a child, but had never been baptized or anything. We of course were in the balcony, far from the front. It was a long walk, I even slipped and fell on the stairs as I went down.  A few weeks later I was baptized. Looking back, I know I wanted to do what was right in God, but no one had explained to me yet that I needed to rid myself of al the sin in my life.   The were some tumultuous years in college as I fought to be in the world and in God. But I will explain some more about that in my next post...<\s>Each year, I have to teach my students about what I find acceptable and unacceptable in class and on stage. I generally start that discussion by announcing that my husband is a minister and that I have been a missionary and finish it with'remember, nothing rude, crude, or socially unacceptable.' That generally is enough to make the kids be careful of what they say. Of course, it also opens up a whole new conversation which is answered with 'No, the youth minister over at Trinity is my brother-in-law, not my husband.' :)  Today, I gave Drama I directions for the 'bag game'. My students have to decorate a brown lunch bag (I stopped in the pouring rain last night to get some)and put some items in it and then tell the class about their bag as an introductory activity.

(yes, I had a couple of skulls in the bags before)  b. Nothing illegal (every year I have remind several 16 year olds that drinking in SC is not legal until they are 21 regardless of what they did last weekend.)  c. Nothing that can be stepped on and be broken. (I have discovered that teenage boys have big clumsy feet.)  We will see how things work out on Monday. Drama I has the bag game and Drama II and Drama III/IV have performances due. The performances are to be a story that they tell the class. We will see what","<s>Rick teased me this morning that he wasn't sure I stayed up late last night because I did not blog. I did stay up (1:30 am) but I was working on things that need to be done for the major event that we will be doing at church in 2 1/2 weeks. On July 17, the women in our church will be hosting the 2nd annual Fashion Share at our church.   The concept is that we invite women who are in 'hard times' usually from shelters to have a luncheon and fashion show at our church. After the lunch, we have the fashion show. It is with women from our church so we all hoop and holler for the ladies. After the show, there is a time of shopping for these women. All the ladies of the church have donated nice clothing for these women. It may sound like a project that could be condescending, but you have to know our church. We are not a large church, we are not affluent, and this event requires lots of hard work from all of the women in our church. I will handle lighting and music for the fashion show. I will also raid the drama closet at school for racks for the clothes and for decorations for the church.   Last night, I was making corsages. I have a total of 50 to make. I have made bows and cut artificial roses for about 28 of them. Rick awoke to bows laying all over the dresser in our bedroom. My goal is to have them and the 50 bows for gift baskets done by this Sunday. I still need to find music for the fashion show. I cannot find the CD we used last year.. drat. That would have made my work much easier. Lighting won't get done until the week of the show. I can't move the lights until after the Sunday service.  Those of you who read this... Please pray for us to find a caterer. The one we thought was going to donate his services has backed out on us. Last year the caterer donated everything. Right now, our best option will cost 550.00.

I often spend a lot of time on gifts. the coolest gift I think I ever got was an red metal airplane that I got from Amsterdam for one of my best friends, who just adored flying and hasn't wished for anything except of being a pilot (which didn't happen) I searched all over the country for the plane and all my friends thought I was crazy and laughed at me, until I saw that plane in a shop in Amsterdam and I couldn't help but buy it!

197,"which I remember sobbing out.  He immediately dropped the brush and pulled me into his arms, holding me, rocking me, petting me and whispering nonsense to me.  Just letting me cry.  It felt so good to cry like that.  Cleansing, but I didn't understand why at the time.  He asked if I wanted to be held or make love after I stopped crying and I wanted both.  So I got both, he held me until I felt like more.  I told him I wanted to suck him first.  I loved doing that, I felt so good just laying there sucking his cock, giving him pleasure.  I wanted to make him come that way, but I wanted to have him inside me too.  So he made love to me.  Afterwards I asked him to rub lotion my bottom while I got myself off again with one of my toys.  He fingered my ass a little while I was getting off and that made it even better.  Shameless, I know.  I don't remember talking that night, I'm sure we did but I don't recall what was said.  I just remember falling asleep exhausted and very satisfied and a little confused.  I didn't expect what happened, wouldn't have sought it out and if asked, would have said I didn't want it.  But once I realized where he was taking it, I wanted to see how much I could take.  To see if I could get the release I read about so much.  That I had seen him achieve when I dommed him.  I didn't know if I could do it, if I could let go enough.  Boy did I.  But the big surprise was still to come.<\s>After a couple of lengthy IM chats with Erik Monday and Tuesday I was very aroused and more than a little confused.  Mixed in with the usual cyber-sex back and forth was a lot of demands for my submission.  And that made me really hot.  But I was still denying that I was a sub.    Wednesday Eben came home from out of town family business.  I barely greeted him and he immediately got into his games and I got online to look for trouble.  You see, I had been exchanging emails and fantasies with Erik for about a month and a half but never chatted with him before Monday night.  And even though I felt guilty, I had to see if he was online.  I needed","When we got together, this is what Anna wanted:  Play time is limited to 2 hours on weeknights that we play. She plans on making significant use of the 'Immunity' necklace.  She did not make it clear if weekends would be more lifestyle, or just larger blocks of time, I'll have to nail that down.  We changed the greeting to more easily help her slip into the mindframe she needs.  She wants simpler scenes, and has safeworded certain kinds of scenes and bondage.  She agreed that while we were in our timeblocks of play that she would agree to be mine to use and play with in the manners that please me. And she believes that the 'House Rules' can be kept and still used effectively.  She wants to carry out this plan for 30 days then decide if she wants to continue or not. So this agreement will expire July 12.  I've published this for benefit of Erik and myself so we have a clear guideline to follow. Hopefully, Anna will have the time and space she needs to decide for herself if she wants this kind of life or not.<\s>It's been a slow week on the surface, but minds have been racing. It's not what you call on subject but I do have a bit of a rant.   I was chatting with a friend of mine in California today when she told me of an incident where some brats yelled at her from a moving car, 'Hey, try Jenny Craig!' I told her that this is why God invented the rocket launcher. Now she takes things in good stride, and she says that she only gets down on herself occasionally, but there are many many more that are not so fortunate. They take things like that to heart, and into relationships, and to bed. And that is where I begin to take it personally.  It's never been made really clear here but I don't mind putting it bluntly, if a woman weighs less than 200lbs, she probably isn't even going to catch my eye. Now before you go off with your comments and snickering e mails I have one thing to say; fuck you.  I not only have a brain in my head, I know how to use it enough to make up my mind about what I consider attractive and what I don't. I don't need Cosmo, or Hollywood, or joe lunchbucket standing next to me in line at the store to tell me this is attractive and that is not. Most",blog_2715,blog_2715,True

It just so happens I got the second place one, a 1000$ online shopping spree.  I knew there was a catch.. there had to be.. 1000$ on a 2000$ order, or you have to sit through a seminar on car buying.. something like that.  Turns out, the catch is two-fold.  First, you have to pay a'shipping and handling fee' for each item.  Individually.  There is no singular S&H fee like from real shopping sites, there's a fee on each item.  They're not too bad, though, considering the quantity of merchandise we can obtain.  But...  Second, the site is crap.  They've got a total of  maybe  150 different things, no video games, no books, not even a VCR.. and of the items they do have listed, about half are 'temporarily' out of stock.  Still though, there are a few nice things.  A cordless 3/8' drill, of which I actually have need.. a spiffy leather trenchcoat, and some decent gift items.  It won't be a perfect Christmas, as of course they don't have anything that's on anyone's lists, but hopefully the items are of decent quality, as opposed to cheap dollar store knockoffs.<\s>It has come to my attention that I suck at Ghost Recon.<\s>Well, Brian and Cassy are gone, and now it's nothing but old people and their grandkids in church.  Everyone knows, or at least should know by now, considering all the questions we've been asked (on a weekly basis sometimes), that  we're not staying.  In six and a half months we'll be gone, too.  Actually closer to six months now.  We tell them we traveled 900 miles to come here only so I can go to school.  We have no family here, we have no established friends here, I am not here to start a life, or a family, or a business.  When school's out,  we're gone.  I don't know why these people continue to insist that we have kids, or start a business here, or find work here.   I don't want to stay here, Diamond doesn't want to stay here,  WE ARE NOT STAYING HERE!<\s>Well, yesterday was fun.  Spent most of the day",blog_13429,blog_4460,False
199,"Who could have done that?? Hmmm....I wonder....  We have some time to kill so once again I found a library but once again I cannot upload pictures. Damn governmental conspiracy I say. This town is nice as it seems to date back to the early 1900's. You would think that a place like this on Lake Michigan would have more waterfront property but I suppose that is just in Florida. Its a bit better this way but I am looking forward to the boat ride tomorrow...just hope for no rain.  Gonna run for now...more to come<\s>July 29, 2004 - Router Day - Waupun to Plymouth, WI (58 miles)   I was actually worried a bit this morning since this route has never been done before. I certainly did not want a repeat of a couple of days ago. I was already in a somewhat grumpy tired state since the gym we slept in last night in Baraboo, WI was about the size of a large cardboard box. Nothing like snoring in stereo at close range. I had to kick someones feet last night because of their snoring. Earplugs only do so much..then again..a pillow over their face would do even better...but I hear they have laws against that.  Waupun, WI..a town where I still have a hard time pronouncing. The high school here is really nice...and huge. This place is a maze. Folks are inside the theater (yes...theater) watching the movie Cold Mountain. I am amazed that some of these bicyclists can sit in a movie that does not involve bicycles. Perhaps there was a messenger that rode his bike across the battlefield and gets shot or something.  Started the route onto the back country roads I have grown to love and lament over so much. We will be riding into the Kettle Moraine State Forest tomorrow. This place looks nice from a car so I am hoping it is just as nice on a bike. I am looking forward to the watering hole (swimming hole...not drinking establishment) that I found for us to use as our picnic stop. Its a huge lake surrounded by picnic tables and open fields along with some trails that lead to who knows where. If it stops raining..it should be a nice ride. Of course it starts raining 15 seconds after I get my bike out of the trailer.  Tonight its about laundry which is desperately needing to be done as my bike shorts are standing on edge making me do the same. Finally","in the trailer when a gust of wind came and pushed the door into my bike which was conviently being held up by me in front of my face so now I have a nice little cut on my forehead. Just another reminder about this trip to take with me for a while.   July 24 2004 - Router Day - Northfield, MN to Pepin, WI (72 miles)   This was the route that Keith and I were trained on when we spent that glorious week in Cannon Falls, MN at the start of the trip. Therefore, it was nice to see the marks remaining on the road after all this time. Just a few touch up arrows. This is going to be a nice trip as long as the wind coorperates. We go through the town of Red Wing, MN where the Red Wing Shoe and pottery&nbsp;companies are located. On my way back from Pepin, I grabbed lunch with Paul who led us on the tour in the begginning. We got caught up and I filled him in on the current trials and tribulations of the trip. Didn't seem to surprise him one bit having gone through this ordeal, excuse me...experience, himself.   Rest of today was pretty laid back. Found some nice off road trails leading back into what else? Corn fields, of course. Should be getting back as Jeremy called me and wants to see if I can get back early...sort of told him I was on the road. (Hope he doesn't read this during this week) Oh well..  &nbsp;<\s>DeSmet to Watertown, SD (60 or so miles)    Last night I slept inside the closet. Before anyone starts making comments and thinks I have been spending a bit too much time looking at the animals..please allow me to explain. The gym we were staying at was not air conditioned. The only room that was air conditioned was the room we used for meals so therefore like most sane people would, I moved my bedding in there. To get some privacy, I slipped into one of two closets and shut the door. It was quite nice and cool until the breakfast ladies showed up at 5:00am. Of course, they were tip toeing around so as not to wake us right? Wrong! They moved on in like they were setting up for the pre-game show at the Super Bowl. Since my slumber was disturbed, I moved back onto the gym floor. Surprisingly I",blog_6892,blog_6892,True
