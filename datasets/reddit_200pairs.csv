The cycle of poverty is a problem with governments?  I don't think so.  It takes money to make money (aka potential capital gain is a function of existing capital).  Furthermore, it provides you with the free time and access to resources where you can further your knowledge and skills.  Socialism (communism is post-scarcity socialism) doesn't do anything to fix those problems because such a problem could not exist under that framework.  The means of production are socially owned.  So if you had an idea for a business you wanted to start, you could submit your idea, a business plan, etc... to an allocation committee, who would then give you the money to start your business.  There are many ways to implement this, and this is just one idea; but the point is that under socialism the basic necessities of everyone are met, and if they wanted to start a business, all they need are good ideas and implementation.

&gt;There are hundreds of businesses that don't have very high startup costs.
&gt;The means of production aren't some limited, unobtainable set of resources. They are relatively cheap.

My earlier comment about barriers for the petite bourgeoisie competing with large corporations is applicable here.  Small businesses usually do poorly here in the US.  Around 2/3 fail in 10 years: https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_March_2014_0.pdf.

Socioeconomic class is more heritable than genetic height, which is a hallmark example of a strongly inherited phenotype: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10181.html.  Small businesses on average start in the middle class; and the owners on average stay in the middle class, even if they fail.  Their children will most likely be middle class too. You seem to be defending small businesses a lot.  And the problems of capitalism aren't truly pronounced in the petite-bourgeoisie; they arise when we look at large corporations.  And given the trend of capital accumulation where there is capital, even with significant noise, the asymptotic evolution of the dynamical system will always equilibriate to monopolies and large corporations existing, the negative effects which are slightly softened with antitrust laws and whatnot.<\s>General relativity and quantum mechanics both were developed in the past 100 years...<\s>Quantum mechanics continued to have significant development",reddit_1045095,reddit_1019175,False

They'd also need to provide a greater incentive to go through them. A chest with ritual blood (3) is not exactly a thrilling discovery. Finally, they would need account wide progress. It was daunting to go through them once. With new characters, it's just a tedious chore.

The PS4 was fairly new when Bloodborne released, and they've had a year and a half of development time to improve and hopefully get more efficient and get more performance out of each platform. Also, I think that DaS3 began development before BB.

Moreover, the claim that flags and rifle are snap BiS are patently false. A lot of their itemization is tied up in the +1 skills, so if you're not using the skills, it's not guaranteed that you need the artis.

Grinding CHT to get artis to trade to other people is probably a waste - I see so many people selling CHT artis in trade, so, so, so many people, but barely anybody buying anything other than flag. CHT is a great source of CDR chips, unstable molecules, cosmic medallions, and lucking out on the new hightown medallions (especially the unique one). It's also a decent source of essences, insigs and cores, but probably about the same as CMM on the whole, for those. Maybe better than CMM for insigs.

You grind CHT if you need one of the items *for yourself*; you grind CMM if you need experience (which should be your priority for this insane XP weekend, gotta get them omegas).<\s>Why would you use Doom medallion...?

Oh, it's on this build.

Yeah, no, don't use Doom medallion. Totally useless on Iron Fist. This build's choice of slot 2 and slot 5 unique sucks too, darkhawk/jocasta are much better choices. ILAS is a waste, too, it should be mayhem or brooch.

Medallion should be Red Skull (if you've got it) or Kurse. The new CHT unique medallion is decent as well, I just don't like slamming medkits every cooldown. Grim Reaper is another decent alternative.

I","&gt;but since I'm playing Nightcrawler I want to make sure I'm not holding back my team

Well, kid, I've got some bad news; a Nightcrawler in i69s is gonna get outperformed by a real character in i63s. Red musp isn't hard, but playing Nightcrawler means that you're definitely not going to contribute an appreciable portion of your group's DPS. Fortunately, most people who put together red musp pugs probably don't even know that, so as long as you show up in i66s with fully blessed good artis, they'll let you in.<\s>Actually, the appropriate (official) plural is Squirrels Girl, like Attorneys General.<\s>Heurgh, that's a waste. Black cat doesn't need a normal tri (unless you're going deep on Overload), let alone an armored tri.

Jeeze... just so you understand what you (basically) threw away, an armored adamantium tri is like 50+ goks.<\s>&gt;Is there a level where you think a Nightcrawler could be 'good enough' to not be considered a deadweight?

Basically... no. Whenever I see a NC in my raid (which is very infrequently), I just chalk it up as one of the freebie slots that I normally hand out.

It's fine to play who you like, but keep in mind that even fully kitted out i69s, i80 leg, 10k omegas, etc, the works, you are worth less than half of a Rogue. Two Nightcrawlers = one Rogue, and that's terrible.

If you're concerned about your performance, try to find a hero you enjoy playing that ISN'T literally the worst character in the game. Melee Magik's playstyle is close to Nightcrawler's, so you can try her out, and my personal recommendation is Iron Fist (it's always Iron Fist).

My ears clog up once every six months or so, most of the times I went to a doctor to get this done (I'm german, so ymmv). The times I've tried to do it myself my ear got infected. So take it from me, I've had to enure this bullshit for well over 5 years by now and know how this works. Don't stick anything in your ear, no q-tips, no paperclips, nothing. If you do and your ear starts to hurt, everything you do at home, short of antibiotics, will make it worse.  
What the docotor will do depends.  
 A ""normal"" (whatever they are called) doctor will usually use a huge syringe with water to blast everything out. Not the best, but also not the worst solution. It might lead to headaches, if the water is too cold or hot, but I always was asked if the temperature is ok.  
When I went to the hospital beause nothing else was available at the time and it got annoying, the guy decided to use what's basially a sterilised paperclip and scrubbed it out. Definitely the worst thing to get done, because he injured my ear and I had headaches for days after.  
The best one by far is to go to a doctor who specialises in ears, throat and nose stuff. Those guys have a chair that looks an awful lot like a dentists chair without the drills, but with some thing that's basically a small vacuum with a light and a camera on it. It's used to suck out the smaller stuff, everything else that's too big to be sucked up will be flushed out with a smaller version of the metal syringe. It's basically the same, but much more gentle since there isn't as much pressure behind it.<\s>This happens every time GradeA posts a video","ass kicked up one side and down the other ever since finishing my ten qualifier games. I'm constantly being matched against people with custom ""season 2 grand champion"" tags on their names and it gets frustrating really quickly.<\s>I couldn't agree more. I think part of the problem stems from the fact that Psyonix decided to max out the level you could achieve from your ten ranking games at Prospect Elite or somewhere close to that. I believe they should have put it near Challenger Elite so that people would be spread out more. Then have the system re-rank you more aggressively. This way, all players would rise and fall more quickly to where they should be.<\s>It's natural for people to get frustrated when they lose many games in a row against people much better than themselves. My personal opinion is that the rank changing algorithm isn't aggressive enough, causing too much time spent grinding for the really good players. This grinding probably isn't that fun for them, nor is it fun for the lower-skilled players who have to suffer a lot of repeated losses.

I agree patience is warranted, it's just frustrating when you love playing the game and naturally don't want to lose all the time.<\s>I don't think you got what I was suggesting.<\s>Beautiful.

Ranks move both ways. I'm just saying there should be a wider placement area for right after the first ten games.<\s>I think you're making it more complicated than what I'm suggesting. They're already assigning ranks to people from Prospect I to Prospect Elite (maybe one or two higher, not sure) based on those ten matches. I'm suggesting they spread out the assignments to Prospect I to Challenger Elite. This would speed up the grind for people like Kronovi, getting them out of the lower ranks where their skill becomes extremely frustrating to lower-skilled players. If a player wins their ten matches through no skill of their own (carried), they'll lose rank again soon enough.<\s>Okay, but people should have been assigned that high at the very start.<\s>Then what's the point of the ten placement games",reddit_1041295,reddit_100136,False

23,23,"now, so you got that covered. 

Your number one priority is giants b10. For that your bella needs around 16k or more, shannon probably needs to be 6*, bernard needs around 15k hp and some decent speed, and ofcourse Veromos (Which you should start saving devilmons for)

Any other questions?<\s>Congratulations!<\s>If you go chasun, your only damage dealer is Ritesh, which can go in 2 ways.

First, your opponent can go suicidal on you, and try to perhaps double lushen your AD, the outcome of that mostly depends on your HP (Which I believe is high enough) and molly's passive, and the turn after that you'll probably wreck him.

Or, they can just easily sustain you, because your only damage dealer is Ritesh, and he if they manage to kill him, the rest is just stall...

Your best option is to try them and see what works better imo.<\s>The exclusive summon is a LIE!<\s>She does need to be 6* for faimon hell, and she needs as much atk crit rate and crit dmg.

I'd suggest Fatal/Blade with atk/crit dmg/atk, try to get around 145 speed for faimon hell just to make sure you go first (boss at third wave has 142 speed if im not mistaken) and if you can't get your crit rate to around 70% on subs, just go crit rate on 4 and try to reach 100% crit rate<\s>DAT TROLL<\s>Oh geezus... that's just.. not nice.<\s>At what part of the game are you? Can you link us a monster box? 

Anyway, I would never 6* Ramagos, so Copper is probably the one I'd choose.<\s>I could lushen this so fast you'd cry.<\s>That's incredibly helpful and reassuring, thank you!

Just a couple questions, is your hwa max skilled? And how much speed does she have? Because I do have 3 hwas (two collecting dust in storage), perhaps I should build one specificly for nb10?

Also, my Zibrolta is runed full revenge, and he's doing a GREAT job so far, don't you think running speed","annoying you on chat... It's really not that hard.

I would down vote you, if I wasn't lazy to change my preferences in reddit.<\s>Megan is for a face team, you are not there yet.

I would suggest running Verdehile (L), Vero, Bella, Baretta, Briand and going L&gt;R&gt;Boss<\s>Veromos takes priority over Kumar although he is a great nat 5.

Do Veromos and then him, unless you get something super good like Praha or Perna before maxing Veromos<\s>Yes, a person who looks for a secret dungeon, and a person who promotes scamming sites are on the same level because both of them write several lines in the chat at once.

./logic<\s>It did work for me, and now that I have advanced in the game and no longer look for secret dungeons, if someone spams the chat for SD I just block him... next time I login the mute will wear off, and he'll probably be done with the SD... Big woop, why go through the trouble of making a thread if you can just hit 2 buttons to block someone?<\s>Alright so, my vero and bella should be okay I guess, I don't wanna change bella to swift again, she's currently on 162 speed so I guess I'll try it.

My Sigmarus has 94% cr and 160 CD, I believe he'll be able to do some decent damage, and as for Megan... I guess I'll need to get some good runes for her first lol

Do you have a swarfarm monster box, so I can check your stats/runes?<\s>The thing about spectra, he probably needs to be spd cr/cd accu.. Which leaves him no hp at all, so I'm assuming he's more of a speed rune monster... I'm looking for a slower but safer runs, so I guess I'll put him on the backburner atm.

I guess I'll try with friend's Miyang first to check then.

Really su? I thought she's great for dragons..

And I guess you're right, I'll probably run spectra when I aim for speed runs<\s>Here brother from another mother, have my upvote.<\s>Bother",reddit_104629,reddit_104629,True

I definitely think there is an opportunity for someone to start a ""Bulk Jerky Club"" and just strike bulk deals with Jack Links, Oberto, Krave and the 100 or so other jerky makers in the US who mass produce jerky and try to get members the most jerky possible w/o regards to ingredients, flavor assortment, dietary fit, customer service, etc.<\s>For sure, if you want to get 1 brand of jerky. I send you multiple brands and typically from smaller batch jerky makers than Big Johns. 

True story, a few years ago, John sent me a generous supply of samples for consideration for SumoJerky. My wife and I brought the samples with us in our carry-on backpack as snacks for a flight from Austin to Ireland.

Ended up, his jerky saved us as we got stuck overnight in limbo at JFK airport baggage claim area (lost luggage, missed connection etc) for something like 7 miserable hours w/o food and we were starving. 

The only food we had were those Big John's Jerky samples and it was a god send. I thanked him but maybe this is my karmic opportunity to really repay him :).<\s>It's a lot less sophisticated and more personal:). You tell me what you like via email and I try to match it up.

IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT FUCKING TERRA IN FF6 BEING A SOLDIER FOR THE EMPIRE IS NON-CANON.  DO YOU KNOW HOW FUCKING INSANE THAT IS?  IT WOULD INVALIDATE THE ENTIRE GAME.  THAT'S NONSENSE.

SOMETIMES SHIT STORYTELLING IS JUST SHIT STORYTELLING.  YOU DON'T GET TO JUSTIFY IT WITH CLAIMING THAT IT'S SHIT BUT ISN'T ACTUALLY PART OF THE STORY.

REMEMBER WHEN DARTH VADER FORCE CHOKED THAT ONE ADMIRAL?  I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.  VADER IS JUST A NICE GUY.  THAT SCENE IS SO NON-CANON.  BAM, STAR WARS IS PERFECT NOW.

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?<\s>&gt;Something they already know the playerbase hates?

Hey, at least SE doesn't also hate FATEs.  They like them.  Know what they put in that everyone, developer and player alike agree didn't work out like it should have?  Hunts.  Know what they doubled down on in HW?  Hunts.  In exactly the same form.  WHY!?<\s>&gt;I was thinking about getting back into XIV, but one of the issues I had back when I played, (which was quite a while ago I'll admit) was that crafting was literally a money sink. Short of being max level and slotting gear, there was no",", and thus have a sense of progression.  More bosses lets you keep that progression feeling longer and also allows for a more gradual difficulty ramp so you don't get stuff like Midas where 2 floors go okay and then you slam face-first into a brick wall.<\s>I sure miss the written word.  It's so much more appropriate to translated things.

----

EDIT: The most newsworthy part of the interview seems to be Yoshi-P being asked if Feast is successful and if he'll give figures as to participation.  He refused to give figures to 'prevent fueling the controversy'.  Seal Rock was popular but Feast is hard because each player matters more.  Suggested they have many ideas to further encourage PvP (such as the upcoming duels for practice, custom matches, and spectator mode) so they're not giving up on it.  Expecting some sort of streaming content (Twitch) pick up of PvP matches due to it.  Says that ""just drop PvP and use PvP development resources on PvE"" arguments don't make sense because they have ""a PvP and PvE team"".  

----

Of course refusing to release participation figures for The Feast to 'prevent controversy' just means they're bad.  Not really hiding anything there.  Why those PvP developers can't be moved to PvE projects is beyond me.  :P  Also there's no real chance of FFXIV PvP becoming popular on twitch, but keep dreaming I guess.<\s>Accuracy until you don't miss dungeon/hunt stuff (shouldn't take much) &gt; Piety (per your choice) &gt; Crit &gt; Det &gt; SpS.

WHM stat weights are largely up for debate and always have been.  Spell Speed remains a near-zero value stat for WHM for me and should be avoided at all costs.  There's a whole slew of WHMs that will tell you the exact opposite.  There's a ton of WHMs that will say crit is bad.  There's a ton of WHMs that will say piety is worthless.

It depends on your play style a great deal.

The crit and speed tables should be the same for everyone as far as I know, and there's been fairly extensive testing on it with Bards, so I'd search that up to get an idea.

The second method takes advantage of elliptic curve multiplication.

So you would give the physical bitcoin creator an ""Intermediate Code"", which is something that can be generated from your password, and he would then use that code to create an encrypted key for you.

First things first, Warrior is vastly outclassed by Bloodrazor. Bloodrazor gives a good amount of attack speed and an additional on-hit effect that synergizes really well with Runaan's Hurricane and your passive.

Ghostblade is great item for when you're against squishy teams, or if you're ahead early on in the game. Otherwise, it's not really that great. I wouldn't consider it a core item, but it's very nice in the before mentioned situations.

Runaan's Hurricane is a great core item, since it has the potential to almost triple your damage and gives you some very nice AoE. It's a great 2nd or 3rd item, so just keep building that.

Maw of Malmortius is really good against Magic Damage heavy teams, but not really all that useful in any other way. The flat Attack Damage and Armor Penetration bonuses are nice, however.

Boots of Swiftness are out of favor at this point in time, and another pair of boots like Ninja Tabi, Mercury's Treads and Berserker's Greaves are generally better purchases, both in slot- and gold efficiency.

Other items you could consider are: 

* Frozen Mallet, since it gives a great survivability boost and makes it a lot easier to chase and kite enemies. Great later purchase, if deemed necessary.

* Black Cleaver, as it gives Health, Cooldown Reduction and some Armor shred. I personally don't build this very often, but it's great against teams stacking Armor, and it also helps out any other Physical Damage-oriented champions on your team.

* Mercurial Scimitar, the alternative to Maw of Malmortius. MS has the advantage of being able to cleanse CC, which can be a life-saver in many situations, and also allows you to keep dealing damage, as you're not disabled.

http://masteroverwatch.","&gt;Thorbjörns turret can ride the levitating pads in the Objective B area of Volskaya.

Its not the interaction with the platforms thats the problem. Torb's turrets are really strong in low level play right now with the recent changes. the problem is the turret, not that its on a platform.

if they removed the ability to put the turret on the platforms, they might as well remove the ability to put bastion on it, or turret on the cart or to bastion on the cart and thats dumb. removes pretty much any viability bastion and torb have on attacking which is already low. also removes depth from the interaction of the ability with the map. its rewarding creative use of turret placement. the platform one also sacrifices some defence advantage so its balanced. Also if theres 3 turrets on a tiny platform it should be pretty easy to blow em up with a pharah. an ult or some coordination with a reinhardt should suffice.

&gt;Tracers ultimate feels akward to use.

I agree the range is a bit short but shes SUPPOSED to blink three times and throw it. the combo is 2 or 3 blinks throw and recall, that get it where it needs to be, kills a couple ppl or more if ur good and gets you well out of danger.

&gt; D.VA dies to her own ultimate.

This is your own fault. D.Va's ult can be blocked by literally any barrier no matter how thin. it can also be thrown with the rocket boosters. YOU have to be the one to think ""if i ult here can i hide from my explosion?"" because her ult is strong and such a large blast radius she SHOULD be able to die from it. its balanced. you're just not using it right.

&gt; Does Genji have improved melee damage?

He doesn't. He shouldnt. his improved melee is his ult. hes already strong at close range he doesnt need it.

Because it's just so painfully rich.  It basically amounts to ""Why do I have to pay for these things I want, why can't you pay for my stuff?""  We have democratically decided that we don't want to pay for yours (or ours) X/Y/Z.  But you are free to do so with your own money, and that is *fair*.  That's a liberal democracy for you.

Consider the alternatives:  We are forced to keep spending up against the will of the people for the sake of Scotland.  How is that preferable, from the perspective of what a democracy should be?  Alternatively, another evil would be to force you to stop spending and say ""tough shit, you're not allowed to"".  This is the best of both worlds:  you get to spend what you want, and we get to spend what we want -- implicit in that though is the need for paying for it yourself, otherwise it wouldn't be *fair*.  It's a *compromise*.<\s>Yes, when you consider Scotland is already heavily subsidised by the rest of the UK, and that the UK has democratically decided to make cuts  For the SNP to then simultaneously complain about cuts without the mettle to just, you know, raise taxes and reduce cuts with the powers the SNP has been given.  If the SNP has the right idea then it will show itself, and rUK will look mighty foolish.  Win/win.<\s>&gt;The SNP said if you freeze council tax, we'll give you this incentive. When councils decide to unfreeze, they lose the incentive.

That explained nothing since it's clearly spin.  I'm sure there is an element of truth however, but describing it in the vaguest possible terms rather than just actually explaining it, since there's no way it's that complicated?  SPIN.

&gt;I can't make heads or tails of the rest of your post I'm afraid.


That's a shame, it's actually pretty simple, not sure why your brain is struggling to parse what I wrote.

33,33,". No one blames Cespedes here. He did nothing wrong. The rules just weren't interpreted how common sense dictates they should be.<\s>I'm aware of why the call was made. I was just pointing out why Arod was indeed a fair comparison, and not ""absurd"" as you stated earlier. As far as rule interpretation is concerned, it doesn't matter what Arod's or Cespedes' intent was. All that matters is that their contact with the fielder is what caused the loss of ball control. The umps decided that Wainwright never had control to begin with, and that's their judgment. So be it. But the Arod comparisons were both appropriate and non-malicious at the time.<\s>&gt;  it swings the balance too far in favor of the fielders.

I believe this is the crux of our disagreement. I would argue the exact opposite. A fielder has to locate the ball, locate the runner, successfully acquire the ball, reach the runner, and apply the ball to the runner before he reaches base. The runner simply has to run as fast as they can. This is why I believe the fielder should be given the benefit of the doubt on these occasions. But that's just my opinion, and it's no more or less valid than yours.<\s>And I'm not happy they do it that way. Like I said...opinions.<\s>You are correct. In a pre-replay world this usually considered necessary. Even with replay, it's not a terrible rule-of-thumb. I just feel like if a fielder is able to glove a ball and get it in contact with the runner, then you must assume control at the moment of contact, and thus, the runner is out. However I concede that there are times when 'control' is not adequately displayed by the fielder. 

Off topic: I really enjoy this discussion about rule interpretation. Thank you for your level-headed engagement. Too often these debates turn in to name calling.</s>","expiration date — two innings, 75 pitches, or whatever — it’s not good for him.

38,38,"You should never have to rely enough on your secondary stats, that a crit could cost you lives. Overheal is a thing, but a crit can also cause you to only heal once instead of twice. it goes both ways. and if you crit with overheal, its not a big deal. You wont notice it, but if youre tank is like 10k and he needs to be 20k+ and you crit benefic 2, then I'm sure you will notice it.

2) you talk about more aoe healing, only currently A8s requires spam healing aoes. As such, ""more aoe heals"" isn't an issue really because... you would just be overhealing... I can manage my mp at less than 14k whilst doing dps in all the savage fights.

3) spell speed doesn't increase mana consumption. You can get more heals in a period of time, but that doesn't mean you should. Only thing SS has an effect on MP wise is DPSing.

4) Acc, you wont hit next raid tiers caps without accuracy on your weapon. You can barely hit it atm without the relic. 

5) SS I agree can save lives. Piety I disagree. You should manage it more effectively. You should not be stacking piety as its a waste of stats if youre always above 4k mp in every single moment of the fight.<\s>Quick Addition. In some cases, a single target arrow provides enough speed to alter rotations and thus increase dps in that way. For example, an enhanced arrow on monk allows them to double Bootshine. Something which they previously couldn't do. So whilst, I'd pretty much always give Arrow to a blm for sustainability purposes in raids, it is still extremely good for certain classes. This is also the case for MCH and wildfire - allows more skills inside the wildfire timer, and thus scales the damage. 

So in that sense, theoretically blm is the best option (and I think in actual fights it still is) provided no other classes get ""unexpected dps gains"" due to the ability to change rotations. In a raid, if I know that my monk does quite a bit more dps than my blm either over the course of the fight or just in that one section, I would probably give it to them provided I didn't destroy their tp. But obviously that may not work for some groups/fights. Some fights are fine","1. Got an ASP explorer from back in the day, everything is Class D apart from the frameshiftdrive which is A.

First, it's a genuinely great film.  But it's also the culmination of the original animated series, jumping twenty years into its future and cranking up its slow-build quality improvements by an order of magnitude.  Especially if you loved Beast Wars and Beast Machines, you owe it to yourself to watch Transformers Seasons 1+2, followed by The Movie:  they're an essential prequel to the later Mainframe series.

Hasbro changed production teams for seasons 3+4 and tried to shoehorn in a post-movie timeline, so they're spotty at best, and a quality/continuity train-wreck on average.  There are a few call-outs to those later Transformers seasons in the Beast Wars/Machines series, but you won't be missing much by skipping them and going straight from The Movie to the Mainframe stuff.

That's the genius of Forward and DiTillio, though, that they could take even the dregs of seasons 3+4, treat it *all* as canon from the vague distant past, and write some genuinely brilliant in-continuity science fiction.

40,40,"get higher ap and do more on your spells?"". 

The previous rework's passive was giving way too much stats (rabadon, cdr and heal on E) and was always hit or miss as to when you could get your stacks. Now you actually have your new item slot to decide what you wanna get and can sustain with E in lane without waiting your 150 stacks.


TL,DR; Cassio is not a one ability Mage. Love your champ by understanding his needs due its kit and design.<\s>Nah i love the trade off they made too (though they could still adjust one or two things). But sadly ppl only see the bad parts.<\s>I have to admit that her W feels really bad right now because of the minimum range. 
The range nerf on Q will take time to get used to during lane (but that sweet 0.7 ratio looks scary and it honestly is when you land it). 

Imo, her E identity between the normal and enhanced one is what make her feel unsatisfying. Before, it was ""oh yeah time to spam E since i reduced it's cooldown a whole lot while it still does the same amount"" and now it's ""oh finally i can actually do damage with my E and heal""

Her E feels ""ok"" when you manage to poison your target but really underwhelming when hitting one who isn't (basically a farming tool only which feels really bad). On top of that, leveling up E doesn't feel satisfying either because it only up the enhanced one, the normal one doesn't get anything.

I wish they would at least give the heal (or a part of it) no matter what, that way you can sustain through laning phase against poke and make a choice in what to max first between Q and E depending on what you need (sustain or waveclear). They might have feared it would be too much on her if built with catalyst i guess (up to 50 base heal per E looks strong).<\s>Thanks for your input :)

Yeah i agree on that part about the mana refund for tear being deceptive. 800 mana is so much anyway. On the other hand, being able to heal up to 25hp per R with catalyst might create some crazy plays :D #calculated

First, there are business details like wafer supply agreement with GloFo and Samsung being all busy producing whatever it is producing. And then there's tech side - neither had produced a single desktop GPU prior to that AFAIK.

I guess that there's a lot of truth in Raja's answers on AMA in that a lot of density was sacrificed not for the raw performance or efficiency, but for price... I might fancy doing some math with known data to shed the light on why RX 480 is the way it is relative to R9 390X.<\s>I'm not sure myself, hence why I'm asking :) Maybe some wild Gigabyte/ASUS rep will appear?<\s>TIL something new about PCIe slots. Thanks for the info!

Thinking about it some more, it seems like only low-end mobos would have issues. ATX power plug has 3x 12V wires, and if mobo's PCB is good enough it should be able to deliver that power.<\s>Average: 2.5 KILOVOLTS. Daaaaumn, son, where'd you find this?!

Remembering back from AMD slides there was a bit about advanced voltage and frequency scaling. I think that's the keystone of a lot of things-RX-480: overclocking (it tries so hard to get frequency to theoretical maximum that it might be leaving very little of overclocking headroom), power consumption (incorrect voltage reading during calibration at factory, too much safe room to get more chips pass validation, just general jerkiness of an algorithm leading to voltage being higher than it needs to be)...<\s>Uhm, I see those pass-through vents on the linked pic. They are above PCB, there doesn't seem to be any fins above them (so no direct airflow here), and worst of all - fins are parallel to biggest vent dimension, meaning air just can't easily get between fins and into the vent. Unless there's about 3mm spacing between PCB and heatsink, the effect would be barely noticeable.

So, sure, A for effort, execution needs some work.

If somebody gets one to make AMD grate again - I'd love to see simple ""cover the holes and compare the temps"" test :)

It seems that the best way to win is the use cheap, exploitative tactics which rather ruins the whole thing. Also, I thought that anything other than a 1v1 fight wasn't very good.

I built 2 separate designs of ships(one tankier, one more firepower), and later unlocked upgrades where it made sense to not have 2 variants anymore, but 1 combined design. I had to change both designs to be the same, and have 2 separate designs to keep maintaining, even though they're completely identical.

The idea that having protested segregation gives him a free pass on issues of inequality and disproportionality itself represents white privilege, handily glossing over the numerous challenges black and brown Americans face every day that demand a government response. 

What you are hearing from Black Lives Matter is ""Great you protested segregation! But what have you been doing to address the concerns of our generation today?""

EDIT: Irony of all this. I support Bernie Sanders. But admitting rooms for improvement in your preferred candidate is apparently beyond the ability of some.<\s>Actually, that is not what they are saying at all. That might be what you are hearing, but that is certainly not what they are saying. And no, you don't get to use the actions of two activists in Seattle to represent all of BLM.

Fact is, BLM has moved Bernie. His core message of economic inequality did not have much to say about the concerns of people of color until they started giving him a hard time.

I don't think Bernie is bad on these issues. But I certainly understand the core critique made by BLM. And quite frankly, the reaction of most Bernie supporters confirms the need for their activism.<\s>Uggh, of course African-Americans are the worst off economically in this country, and would benefit greatly from Bernie's policies. NO DOUBT!

The core critique of BLM to Bernie is that this is not the holy grail he and many of his followers think it is. The structural and institutional racism in this country would still exist even if Bernie's economic policies were put in place. BLM wants to know what he will do about these other areas.<\s>How long has that been up there? Could it actually have been generated as a response to the demands of BLM? 

Furthermore, just because a candidate has a position on their website, it does not mean they speak to it as part of their stump or core message. BLM was demanding that Bernie address their concerns as part of his core message and stump.

I for one have observed a shift from Bernie over the last several months, from a rigid focus on core issues of economic inequality, to a more expansive message that addresses the specific concerns BLM has raised with him.<\s>I'll be that guy as well....really shouldn't be building stone fire rings where they aren't already around.<\s>Yeah, the","more people got out there.<\s>I did not necessarily suggest a one size fits all policy.

But I am also comfortable having some slack utilization at certain times of the year if it is necessary to let more people use their public lands during peak usage. I mean, adding an additional campsite costs what? A couple of hundred bucks? Clear an area, level, maybe some pea gravel or dirt, a steel fire ring, and a picnic table? And even if we want to go worst case scenario, and throw in producing an EIA, putting in outhouses, and drilling a well, the cost is what? Low six figures? For a facility that can be enjoyed by tens of thousands of Americans over its lifetime?

Spending significantly more money on our public lands is something I totally support. They are currently poorly resourced and understaffed.<\s>I don't think it is dishonest at all. My response to your post was to highlight that there is a continuum of campsites, from the highly developed, expensive to maintain, ranger run type to the 'couple of tables, fire rings, and some gravel' type. The former are often found in National Parks/State Parks, and the latter in National Forests. And while I may not have properly accounted for upkeep costs in the more developed ones, I would argue you were overestimating the costs in the less developed ones. 

I have camped in National Forest campgrounds a dozen times in the last two years. I have never seen a National Forest employee in them. Many of the times, in areas with grass, it hasn't been mowed in weeks when I visit. In many of them, I bet annual upkeep costs approach zero.<\s>",reddit_1036788,reddit_1036788,True

No, not the pools are wrong, not the ""we will have high voter turnout"", not ""the polls will become better before the primary start"" and no, not any other imaginary shit. Currently, like this, Bernie is 100% losing the primary. The probability that Bernie is going to win the primary against Clinton through all the betting companies is 1/18, that is half percent. 




  
So you all have to realize, that you, yes YOU, need to take a vacation from work right now, book a ticket to IOWA and start canvassing. BECAUSE NOTHING LESS WILL ALLOW BERNIE TO WIN.<\s>Yes, long term it will be the same. But what about short term. I think that there are so few people playing 100$ stakes, that potentially if 1million is spinned, it may take a year or so to make the money for it from 2 multiplier. So how is the money covered in the meantime? And what about if in the same short term another 1million is spinned?<\s>thank you for pointing out that 1/18 is not half a percent. And my apologies for the poor grammar, it is 3 o'clock at night currently where i am.

Having said that, you must have a comprehension of how polls work and what the situation considering these elections is all together. It is ludicrous to believe that Bernie will win the primary currently as it is. I personally find this delusion from majority of Bernie's supporters to be extremely disheartening, because yes Bernie could possibly win, but no, not with the supposed ""supporters"", which the most they have done is writing positive post on Bernie Sanders reddit...<\s>My apologies, i forgot to mention this detail, you are also pretty sure that if you raise/bet he will also call.<\s>Thank you for your post, i want to ask, what do you think about learning all the poker theory, when at the end of the day the best poker players produce 51.5% win rates, just 1.5% higher than playing randomly.

Presumably as true libertarian you would only support the police and prison system to be run by the state, everything else controlled by the market. Though any minarchist state works for this argument and the more extreme positions of Libertarianism. That, it would seem to me, would leave a huge gap in creating any equal opportunity, due to natural wealth condensation, which would eventually lead to strong monopolies, oligopolies controlling the markets. The only way i see libertarian thought to be functional is given the assumption that people would act benevolently, so those eventual monopolies and oligopolies would not pursue further profit but would act in the interest of the rest of the people …

I see a great amount of evidence to support the position that people en mass would not be benevolent. How do you deal with libertarianism then?<\s>If you could perhaps include a section about ethnicity then we could indeed see whether Bernie's supporters are predominantly white educated males ;))

(It's a joke, of course there is a response bias to this survey)<\s>WHAT THE FUCK?

Seriously what the fuck, i did not know the primaries were not proportional to people's vote. Just completely speechless, a freaking 15% of the vote is given arbitrarily. Just lost for words, THIS IS NOT DEMOCRACY!!!

It was one thing for Bernie to win the primaries based on people's vote, but if Clinton is simply getting 15% of the ""vote"" irrespectably of what people actually vote then i am a lot less sure whether it is possible to win this already difficult up hill battle...

In this situation Bernie actually needs to secure 59% of people's vote to account for 50% of the delegates vote...<\s>Besides your own feelings on marijuana. 

Bernie did not stain his integrity, he has been supporting marijuana legalization for a long time, back in 2001 he sponsored the state right to medical marijuana act. That's back in 2001! When most politicians didn't even dream about marijuana legalization.

If a normal human can see it, it's got a Physical presence.

The Cognitive aspect is the mind of the person holding the Shard, and the Spiritual aspect is the Shard's essence (mostly lots of Investiture). This gets a little confused, because for example the Dor is primarily both Devotion and Dominion's bodies within the Cognitive Realm, not the Spiritual.

Sazed says it best:

&gt; I have come to see that each power has three aspects: a physical one, which can be seen in the creations made by Ruin and Preservation; a spiritual one in the unseen energy that permeates all of the world; and a cognitive one in the minds which controlled that energy. 

If you haven't read it, Shai also explains it a little better:

&gt; “All things exist in three Realms, Gaotona. Physical, Cognitive, Spiritual. The Physical is what we feel, what is before us. The Cognitive is how an object is viewed and how it views itself. The Spiritual Realm contains an object’s soul— its essence— as well as the ways it is connected to the things and people around it.”<\s>I've never heard anything linking the mists to the Spiritual, and I would be shocked if it were true. It doesn't even make sense, from what I understand of Realmatic theory. 

The Shardpools may act as a junction allowing you to worldhop to the Cognitive (high amounts of Investiture seems to break down the barrier between realms, see also highstorms), but this does not count as the Cognitive aspect of a Shard which, as Sazed points out, is the mind controlling the power.

If you think about it, legal fines are essentially a tax on people who are behaving in a way that the state finds very undesirable.

People don't always act in a socially responsible way, and education won't necessarily solve that.

However, the argument you should find most compelling is that taxing certain behaviours should go towards offsetting the state expenditure that has to cater to that behaviour. For instance, people who drink and/or smoke are likely to cost a nationalised health service more money. Taxing these products essentially pays for their behaviour.

That's really a different argument. Nationalised health services are vital to so many people who cannot otherwise pay for healthcare, but ANYWAY, I don't think this is what this thread is for.

Like in control, defend A / C point (depending on the map) and try to prevent anyone from capturing it period.

Play with disadvantages and try to overcome them.  Use a terrible green sniper or a woefully under-powered shotgun, and do as best as you can with these limitations.  Since you're going in with handicaps, hopefully that will help avoiding tilt because it's no big deal that an OP weapon destroys you because you're at such a disadvantage.  You may feel more accomplished though for winning with the disadvantages though.  (Taking out a hard scoped sniper with a Gozen C, for example).

Yeah, sometimes it will seem that you're in chaos and the game is screwing you over - spawning around 4 of the enemies, all with heavy.  When it really is outside your control, try to relax and accept that sometimes you're just going to have an unlucky game.<\s>I was running 3 hunters b/c of the VoG.

Nobody is claiming otherwise. 

Really, there is a reason why nobody uses low impact snipers in PvE at all, because they just can't OHK mid-tier enemies, let alone do viable boss DPS. 

This is a problem because the mechanics of the game make a complete class of weapon worthless.

If you're editing stuff already consider putting in the time to do some more comedic edits, splicing in funny pictures or things like that can help tremendously! The League community is very discerning with content and you have to work hard to stand out.<\s>I disagree with FoxyFern. I think if you're reviewing a game it's important to give all of your thoughts. However what I do feel is that experiential games should have a complete and total lack of Webcam for the most part. I feel like these sorts of games need to have as little outside interference as possible. 

I tried to LP the Beginners Guide a while back and these sorts of things always feel like I am intruding on the game's purpose when I LP them. Some things are Un-Let's Playable due in large to the point of the game. 

I'm not going to tell you you shouldn't LP these things but I would say that these sort of games feel wrong to watch someone play.<\s>Games a little loud my friend! I would say probably take the game sound down a little so you aren't competing with it for my attention. 

Also I don't know how this is being captured but the level of screenblur is nearly blinding, it makes the LP basically impossible to watch for longer than a few minutes and that's coming from a guy who has watched 13 FNAF World videos today for work purposes.  

Bethesda games are universally difficult to LP because they are about as engaging to watch as paint dry. Tons of fun to play but watching it is torture unless there is a clear purpose to what's happening or HEAVY editing is involved. and by heavy editing I'm talking PenutButterGamer level edits.

Like I said before, Dirt 3 has a lot of things that aren't straight up rallying, and most of the rallying feels like a bit of an afterthought - The tracks are wide, smooth and fairly easy to navigate, especially with the new-user friendly controls and physics. Dirt Rally is punishing, exciting and magnificently addictive if you have the mental strength for it.

Honorable mention #2 goes to Grid Autosport - It's a massive improvement over Grid 2, and has more'sim-like' physics when compared with it's predecessors. The Career mode is strong, and the selection of cars is far better than Grid 2.<\s>If you enjoyed Hitman Absolution, then i must reccomend the predecessors to that game. Silent Assassin, Contracts and Blood Money are all rich with content and challenging missions. You may find them to be more hardcore than the latest entry, but gameplay is quirky, tense and...admittedly sometimes a little bit awkward. Regardless, they're all really good games, and the level design alone makes it worth checking out (for a very low price might i add!)

If you like the walking dead, The Wolf Among us is another strong Telltale game - You might be put off by the initial appearence of the franchise, but it's a fantastic experience, and is often regarded as the second best Telltale series (behind TWD Season 2)

The teachers or school officials must have reasonable suspicion that the phone is being used for an incriminating activity.  Whether or not a student is required to unlock their phone depends on context.  The following are examples I can think of that the court, based on existing case law, would justify the school compelling a student to unlock their phone for a search.  

1.  Student was caught staring at a iphone during the middle of exam.  There is reasonable suspicion of academic dishonesty.  
2.  Student was seen trying to take an upskirt photo on school property.  There is reasonable suspicion of sexual harassment.  
3.  Students were seen recording a physical altercation on their","starts with the wife.  If there is no wife, then it goes to the children or the children heirs.

A work for hire agreement means you fork over your copyright interest in the music video.  You will still be considered an author of the copyrighted work, but not the owner of said work.  This means you will have no rights or interests in any revenue generated by the work, control how, where, and why the work will be performed in public, you will have no say to subsequent transfers of the work, and you will lose the right to prosecute infringers of your work.  You will essentially disassociate yourself from the work.  

Signing a work for hire agreement also means you lose the right to creative derivative works.  This means that the manager gets to build upon your original work to make new videos.  This also means you will need his permission if you want to make derivative works out of the original video.  Which also means if you shoot anything similar to the original video, you could possibly be served with copyright infringement.  Work for hire agreements are not something you should sign lightly without serious considerations.  

Without the work for hire agreement, you will be considered a joint author, giving you joint control and use of the work.  If you want to learn more about this, I would suggest reading Reid v. Community for Creative Non Violence and the mess they got themselves into.  

Can anyone touch on the validity of a work for hire agreement without consideration?  If you are not getting anything in return for signing a work for hire agreement, then there is no consideration, thus making the contract illusory.

That is to say that without actually DOING something, no matter how much you hear or talk about it, you really just don't know what it's like.<\s>It's not like an agree disagree thing... until you actually do something, it is impossible to know what doing it is like...<\s>Maybe my analogy was a bit off, but I stand by the idea I was trying to convey (though I may have done it poorly above, so let me try again). 

I'm not saying that you must have sex to be in a happy relationship, and it's totally possible to be in a happy one without it (for certain people, others need it to be happy but it varies from person to person as I'm sure you know), and it's totally possible to get married as a virgins and have a great sex life post marriage. BUT I do think it is impossible to be *sure* that you'll have a good sex life post marriage if you don't have one at all pre marriage; as in there's no way to be sure, not that it isn't possible. 

For example if two people get married as virgins, it's completely possible for them to have a fantastic sex life and click sexually. 

But if two people get married as virgins, it's also totally possible that sexually they just don't work together - and that's something you'd never know if they don't have a sex life together previously. 

Does that make sense? I'm really not trying to offend/judge. I just believe it to be fact that two people cannot know what their sex life will be like without having one first.

Especially now, it's really helpful to patients to know where they will best be served - today. 

Many patients are straight up contemplating why they would renew their registrations this year as the sites you listed and we all use have been lack luster as of late. And word is dispensaries are going through their own unique set of growing pains. For many, registration costs quite a bit and so customer experience is most certainly a variable for many.

It's true that this market is in it's infancy and all three of these dispensaries are supplying way more than they anticipated due to this slow roll out. However, we as patients have real decisions to make so rather than everyone having to find out for themselves, let people share their experiences. 

Isn't it more harmful to tell patients they are ignorant for voicing their concerns than it is to just let them exercise their first amendment rights? The internet has a way of sorting out foolishness in these matters. If the concerns aren't legit, there's going to be quite a few people who will counter.

That actually determines mass gain, but only to a point. It doesn't have much to do with fat vs muscle. 

First you have to consider how much you eat ( and your steroid profile) determines your metabolism. If you starve, your rbm slows, you eat again, it speeds up, so naturally, it is not a pure case of calories in, calories out.

Then, the sugar releases insulin in large quantities which triggers your fat and muscle cells to grow. Then your blood sugar drops and makes you hungry again which makes you consume more. For example, if i eat 4 cups of oatmeal, plus a set amount of fruit and veg and meat a day then I get 5000 calories. If I add honey to my oatmeal, i get an extra 100 calories from my oatmeal cups, but I am also inclined to eat 6 cups of oatmeal plus extra fruit and veg because of my increased blood insulin levels.

If however, i eat that honey/sugar and try to refrain from consuming extra calories elsewhere, my metabolism crashes and my muscles lose glycogen which is not an acceptable daily practice.<\s>Hey man, I have spent years reading about medical journals. Rather than splitting your life and diet up into calories and days. Split itnup into 15 minute segments. If you eat sugar, meaning refined sugar not fruit, something with a hi glycemic index and glycemic load, your body absorbs more calories in 15 minutes than it should, then it spend the next 2 or 3 hours phasing into starvation mode, which fucks with yourmuscle glycogen, recovery, etc.<\s>That is pretty much what I said.

Her part in my favourite subunit which is Logica?(and her kinda taking the leading role in her senior year), her strong friendship with Taguchi Hana(my favourite moment was when she decided to sing in the first Archeology of Song class a song in honor of Hana.

However, I recently talked to /u/oldred (i think that was his name) on this thread and he said even though he spins plates, slutty women still bother him.

Pretty much any spellcaster can craft an item as long as they have a formula, are the requisite level, pay the requisite creation cost and are able to cast the spell to create the desired effect. For instance, almost any spellcaster can create a +1 weapon or armor (uncommon items) at level 3, assuming they have the formula and the available funds. Adding fire damage, for instance, would probably make the weapon Very Rare, requiring a higher level, much more time and money, and the ability to cast a spell that does fire damage.

Sharpshooter

* Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

Outdoors with a longbow you can shoot from 300 feet without penalty, well outside most return attack range.

* Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

A fellow party member, like a fighter engaged in melee, between you and your target provides half cover for your target, hindering back rank archers without this feat.

* Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a - 5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack’s damage.

That +10 damage can be awesome, especially if you have someone Bless you to help offset the -5 to hit.<",reddit_102299,reddit_102299,True

Assuming that someone who has appropriately dismissed one irrational claim has also dismissed every other irrational claim in the same way is foolish. There are plenty of people who can explain to you with perfect coherence the appropriate reason for why they dismiss the claims of every other religion in existence but their own, but then can refuse to apply those methods of criticism to their own beliefs. The ability to dismiss some specific irrational claim in a thoughtful way doesn't in any way guarantee that you'll be able to do so for every possible irrational claim.

Finally, you've disregarded your own irrational beliefs. Claiming that it's just different somehow because Christianity requires a host of irrational beliefs doesn't let you off the hook.

The fact is that the really dug-in irrational beliefs are the ones shared by everyone to the point of basically *never* being criticized or scrutinized publicly. Have you ever told yourself that your successes were earned through hard work but your failures and troubles were cause by external factors? This may be beneficial, but it isn't rational.

Have you ever judged or thought you were better than someone for their position in life (homeless, jobless, etc.) even though you've likely been given more opportunities and resources than they ever were? Have you ever been proud or ashamed of anything you didn't earn? Most societies tend to encourage people to be proud of things they didn't necessarily earn. People are ashamed of being short or stupid or proud of being tall or naturally intelligent, but I'm sure you've never held these irrational beliefs, right?

Wouldn't it make more sense to be grateful for things we didn't earn, and only proud or ashamed of what we've done with what we're given? Do you want to do good in the world? Tell me how you rationalize spending any money on frivolous things you want while people are starving to death around the world? You could save lives with your excess money, but you spend it on a tv, or on a car and gas instead of taking the bus, or on eating out, etc. How do you justify it?

What is the risk of disease from roadkill?

-this is a flexible question but mostly yes. dead bodies attract animals and with them pathogens hoping to infect a new host through the un-attended meal, after a few days if the carcass hasn't been completely consumed or disposed of it is crawling in bacteria, parasite larvae, and maggots

How do you remove a moose carcass?

-they actually cut it up, a full grown moose is too large to carry on the average moose truck, and in alaska they want the meat to be easily handle-able because they prepare and eat it, read about that here: http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/041606/people_0416peo002.shtml#.VesnfvnBzGc

Is it legal to collect roadkill, or does it ""belong"" to the town/county/state?

-a lot of states encourage scavenging, the states usually don't want to keep possession of dead creatures even for their valuable parts. some states are overwhelmed by how much road kill they get and they actually run incentive programs to encourage people to collect them, however there are also a lot of states with restrictions in order to deter people from intentionally killing animals with their vehicle such as oregan: http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/hunting/roadkill%20_regulations.asp

Do people ever eat roadkill?

-all the time, illegal or not this is such a common practice that it's mentioned in pop culture regularly. as to whether it's safe or not depends on the animal killed, turtles can infect you with salmonella for example but if properly cooked and cleaned all roadkill is perfectly safe and edible. different states classify collection differently, for example if you have a hunting license then you just hunted but if not the state rules it as an accident automatically. it doesn't matter who picks it up, at least to my knowledge.

It won't.

99,99,"consistent energy gain (most likely with Forcewielder), which requires continuous resources put into it on your end. And even then there are way more efficient ways to use energy like Foundry Engineers or Runelit Incarnate or simply pumping the energy into a Sleep to really disable the big creature.

I'd say about 95% of the time freeze is used exactly like you say it should be. A frozen creature very rarely lives to see another turn. So making it temporary wouldn't really change anything.

However:
With both shields and freeze I suggest another approach to the matter: ""If it isn't broken, why fix it?"" Both mechanics don't provide any problems in the current meta, so why would you want to nerf them? Making cards worse just to make them more intersting doesn't necessarily benefit the game. You could make the most interesting, engaging, strategically deep card ever, but it still wouldn't see any play if it wasn't good.
The dev team team has walked into the trap of nerfing strong but not broken cards before during beta. What happened was essentially violent meta swings caused by small buffs to some cards and small (unnecessary) nerfs to good cards combined. With the good cards nerfed, counters to the buffed cards were suddenly missing and the meta just did a 180 instead of evening out. Even small changes, like limiting the damage a shield can absorb, can have huge implications for the overall balance of the game.

If you want to do better against other players I suggest you check out the official forums and search for a budget deck. Elf aggro decks are very cheap to make and extremely efficient. Check out this thread (https://spellweaver-tcg.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2454) with tournament decklists. The elf deck of the winner Lorenthiel includes only 4 rares and 4 epics and you can substitute both without weakening the deck too much.<\s>Spellweaver has a history of new players thinking cards are broken when they really aren't. I think it's because the game is fairly complex and at the same time deceptively familiar. Things play out differently than in other games and what may be completely broken in Hearthstone or MtG is perfectly balanced or not even very good in Spellweaver. Just check out the dicussions about Murder Instinct.

Those cards look awesome! :D<\s>Channeling gives you the maximum amount of freedom. It let's you pay the cost of the card one energy at a time, even from different cards, until you either payed the full cost with energy or decide to pay the rest with mana.

That means when you have 3 Sunblessed Emissaries on the board and play Angelic Might you can use 1 energy on each of the Emissaries to play Angelic Might without paying any mana and draw 3 cards.<\s>The anti aggro tools have arrived it seems. :D

I read your posts and there wasn't really anything offensive in them. Just some rather valid seeming points about the new cards. If anything, your post could have been moved to the discussion thread for the new secret cards, because it wasn't exactly part of the hype train (I mean there's a reason why we have stuff like a seperate joy and vent thread).

I predict that perhaps this is either a self-regulating measure perpetuated by the human organism in order to stave off over-population, a government conspiracy created in order to eliminate the deepest of thinkers by having them dwell on themselves being FA, or perhaps an alternate theory altogether.

Either by an implantable oxytocin device which will emulate feelings of love, or some sort of simulation which will allow for virtual friends.

Regardless, here's my opinion on what is happening:

The initial problem of the system forgetting which drive to boot from is usually caused by the CMOS getting reset somehow, typically through a dead battery or, on many newer boards, the auto-reset triggered by the system failing to complete the POST too many times in a row. The latter problem usually gets triggered when tweaking settings in the setup, such as trying to overclock the system or using custom RAM timings. 

Still not sure how you could plug the 4-pin power connector in the wrong direction, as they are keyed to try to prevent that from happening, like /u/D_Glukhovsky mentioned. But if you did manage to force it in the wrong way, a decent motherboard will likely have some sort of protection for the components that are powered by that connector, something that functions like a fuse or self-resetting circuit breaker. However, poor quality motherboards may not have such protections in place, which could lead to damage to the CPU, which draws most of its power via the voltage regulators fed by that connector. 

Regarding an OS burning out a motherboard, short answer is no.

There are certain things that software may be able to do to kill a motherboard, but the OS is not going to do that. Most of the time, the OS will actually prevent the bad software from accessing the hardware in a way that will kill said hardware. 

As for checking to see if the board supports Windows 10, it's not really a matter of the board supporting the OS, it's a matter of the OS supporting the hardware on the board.

The fact of it is that by exposure to classification by race in society, people come to see other people differently over time. By the time one is in high school, they will be fully aware of the differences between the experiences of a white child versus a black child in development, or any other race. What you're missing is that this perceived difference has a huge impact on an individual's perception of their place in a community. Imagine what a child thinks if he suddenly finds out his experiences are vastly different from 25% of his classmates? 50%? I can't explain it as well as the study I linked can, but there is definitely a correlation, and none of it is based in prejudice.<\s>I'm saying that your ability to put yourself in other people's shoes is largely determined by how much you can relate to them, and generally, race is a strong correlation here. In modern America, the difference between even a white and a black child from similar economic backgrounds is huge.

I mean that if you have a difficult time seeing the people around you as ""one of your own"" on a very personal level, it will limit your zeal for civic involvement and participating much to better society as a whole.

My advice? Walk away for a few days to let the varnish completely dry and your impatience to subside, then sand it all down to raw wood, removing all of the old finish... with the grain... down to 220 grit and apply a coat of sanding sealer(this will help with the dark spots later). When that's fully dry, sand it down again with 220, clean it off and apply a very thin coat of varnish, then walk away. Have a look at it the next day and if it looks good lightly sand it all down with 220-320 no-load sand paper, clean it off and apply another very thin coat of varnish. repeat this for 3-5 coats and you should have a good finish.<\s>It's just way easier to remove the plaster first.

If you take a look at most scientific studies, they will include things such as the P&lt;0.05, which is to say the chance of the original hypothesis being possible due just to chance is &lt;5%.  In layman's terms, it means that more than likely the null hypothesis is false.  I don't think (in the scientific community) you can prove anything 100% of the time.

However, having a diesel truck modified so that it dumps extra fuel into the exhaust to spew unburnt hydrocarbons into the air leaving large clouds is rage inducing. In states where emissions aren't required, these trucks exist. I can see them being non-existent on the west coast especially in California. I would think CARB would likely impound a truck if they discovered that it had been modified intentional","past the post where we can have an election like in 2011 where the winner was someone who 60% of the voters were strongly against.

Also, I don't think the Liberals are the usual 2nd choice for many Conservative voters.  Yes, they'd probably be the 2nd choice for the centre-right progressive conservatives, but the reform/wildrose conservatives (who make up a large amount of the rural populations in Canada) seem to be more likely to rank a ballot like this:

1. Either Christian Heritage or Libertarian Party
2. Conservative Party
3. None of the Above

Also the NDP is usually the 2nd choice for Liberal and Green Party supporters so ranked ballots could give them an advantage in some areas.

Plus it would end the idea that ""a vote for the Green Party is a wasted vote"" since, if the Green Party loses your riding then your vote would go to the party you would have voted for under FPTP.  This would make it easier for the Green Party to win more ridings (not as easy as it would be under MMPR but still easier than FPTP).

Overall, it's a good system, much better than FPTP.

The skill damage boost from the gauge is also additive (not multiplicative) which means it's really shitty (I believe there were talks of plans to switch it to multiplicative, not sure if they did that yet). MNens were hoping that the 2nd awakening would fix the significant damage dealing fault where 90% of damage comes from spirals and tiger flash autos (which made it impossible to get out of chronicle 9 sets), but this was basically completely ignored. All in all, they remain as damage over time dps'ers that bring almost 0 utility to a party at the raid level (besides a really shitty mdef reduce that equates to roughly 10% damage buff for other magic dealers in the party, which is really bad compared to other utilities), and they don't even excel particularly at damage over time as there are multiple other better alternatives (I actually can't think of a shittier magic dpser right now).

http://www.haygroup.com/en/our-library/whitepapers/gender-pay-gap/

Conclusion: in the UK, for example, there is an unexplained gender pay gap of just 0.8%. If women are paid less than men purely because of their gender, then the effect of that is included in that 0.8% along with other possible factors, such as women maybe being less effective negotiators, etc. I'm not saying any of those things are true - it's the *unexplained* gender pay gap after all - but the bottom line is that together they add up to just 0.8%.

I'm sorry to deprive you of your victimhood.

127,27,"view) to a human sitting 1500M from the (small) object in question is just ludicrous.

When I'm in an aircraft, I have a simple method of determining if an object is on a collision course with my aircraft.  Is it moving relative to my field of view?  If not, I need to evade.  This takes very little thought or computation, and is the result of direct observation - and it ONLY WORKS because my eyes are IN THE AIRCRAFT.  

The reason the FAA doesn't regulate the ultralights to the level we're talking about here is because there is a human's ass in the ultralight aircraft.  The FAA *DOES* regulate that human's behavior, very very very hard.  And they can do this because the human is the control system. On a drone, they cannot regulate the flight of the aircraft by directly regulating the pilot's behavior nearly as effectively because of the lack of first-person observation and the lack of urgency created by the operator remaining safely on the ground.

That's the critical thing.  The person on the ground is risking a multi-hundred or thousand$ toy. The person or people in the air have their lives at stake, and have a human operating the aircraft with them.  That's part of the disconnect in the pilot-vs-drone operator discussions - your asses aren't on the line, and ours are.  There is human life risk on our side, and we have much better human input and control of the situation than you do.  So if you fly where we are, you are introducing a much much much less reliable and safely operated vehicle into our environment, where we are trained for and used to operating around other aircraft with human pilots.  So whenever we hear drone operators getting dismissive or defensive about FAA regulation which is not 1/10 as bad as what we live with all day every day, we tend to dismiss those operators as not serious about the problem.

I take your point about how '99.5% of us fly completely within the boundaries.'  We're not arguing that.  What we *are* saying is that this is not a situation where (I think) we can avoid affecting the 99.5%'s freedom to operate just because they weren't the.5% or.1% who caused a problem - because the result of 'problem' is waaaaaaay more serious than an (economic) tragedy of the commons.<\","of Rich Person(™) locales.<\s>Given a FP for barmitzvah way back when, never used.

SO. I bit the bullet. I put on my big girl pants and went outside. [I made a post while I was out](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossdressing/comments/463v2q/i_went_outside/) but I didn’t really get to fully tell what I did which is what this “mission debriefing” is for :P

First things first, I have a nosy neighbor that tells my mom about anyone coming and going from my house. You might see how this can be a problem when I haven’t told my mom about my crossdressing. Anyway, I got around this by wearing a hoodie out to the car, but lucky for me she wasn’t even home. Once I finally got settled in the car, I had a surge of adrenaline as I realized I was actually doing this! Already it was worth it! 

I started driving to a Walmart a few miles from my house with the intent to buy some makeup remover wipes. I could have easily ordered these on Amazon, but there’s no fun in that! As I was driving, I realized how annoying long hair is… It wasn’t terrible, but all of a sudden you have a few new blind spots. Just gotta drive more carefully, but no worries. After a while, I get to Walmart and park. I check myself in the visor mirror (legitimately the first time I’ve ever done that) and prepare myself to get out. I do it and, what do you know, the world didn’t end. Total relief!

I am however very aware of the people around me. A few look a little longer than I’m used to, but I keep walking paying no attention to them. Even though internally I’m having a mild panic attack. Add to that, I don’t actually know where the makeup remover is. But by some miracle, there’s a single pack of them in the first makeup aisle I walk down! So I grab it,",reddit_1014590,reddit_104669,False

This method most accurately measures your SMV, with the important caveat of *within this particular market.*  A notorious ""party college"" town with a strong hook-up culture will depress individual SMV and *market* RMV, while a military or oil boom town with a 40m:1f gender distribution will artificially inflate them through the roof.

Couples that are within a point or maybe two of each other tend to make the most stable LTRs, and men tend to date down and women up.

Men who are looking for a casual fling will pay attention to SMV almost exclusively.  If a prospect shows no interest in your RMV (long-term interests, personality, potential homemaking/parenting skills), that's an important data point for vetting him.

Men who ARE serious and goal-oriented toward finding a long-term partner will weigh RMV factors much more seriously than raw SMV, to the point his interest in these factors may become obvious.  This is why RPW recommends forever improving your relationship and domestic skills.  Over time, a plainer woman who is an excellent partner has a greater chance of securing the stable commitment of a higher SMV man than a naturally pretty woman who has a crummy personality and brings nothing to the partnership beyond her looks.<\s>This is actually part of the mods' ongoing RPW sidebar/wiki writing project.

131,31,"a super. 5 destroyers kill a cruiser. But suddenly 5 blopses suddenly cant kill a carrier.

A bomber can speed/sig tank anything bs-level and above. Except the carrier. 

Can every carrier pilot stop being spoiled little pricks and explain to me what makes a carrier so special so it is the only ship that nobody can speed/sig tank, that its the only ship which 5 t2 ships two level below can't kill.

I want to microgang and not blob. You cant tell me how to play. The question is whether a microgang should be capable of taking down a carrier. And yes it should. And for the cost argument I wanna say a properly fit blops costs more than a carrier.

But yeah, carriers are not OP because its carrier patch right.<\s>I've been killing carriers since forever. Blopses cant tank carriers anymore. They used to. So I don't dictate anyone terms. A change happened and it unwillingly hurt a niche kind of Eve playing. The question is whether its fair it should do so. And no its not. So my proposals are not dictating terms as you do. They aim to a balanced fair gameplay.

As for the 5 blops vs a carrier, you jam the fighters but there are ways to completely nullify jams, but since none of you know how to, neither the carrier pilots, most of you ""0 knowledge infinite opinions"" people think jamming is the solution and its even OP. But its just a time issue for everyone to get used to how to work around jams.<\s>1) Jams will not work if the carrier pilot knows what he is doing. Most times they don't, but we tested over and over in Sisi, and jams are %100 nullified by knowledgeable carrier pilot. So yeah you will kill the other ones, but its just a time issue until everyone gets to know how to overcome jams.

There are no other ways for the blops to tank fighters apart from jams.

2) Marauders kill carriers but thats why I chose my examples from support role ships, such as bombers vs cruisers and recons vs battleships. They do too are capable of killing solo ships 1-2 levels above them. So why is blops not?

Also Marauders are not a microgang solution and the timer on bastion module makes it pretty hard to hunt carriers in them in hostile","I can cap a marauder out before he kills my drones. Maybe I will just wait to put my drones out until it is capped out. The marauder will just repair the damage until it is capped out anyway. This is why I edited the fit you quoted to not depend on cap boosters but be stable.<\s>Nope my alt is only covops capable for now. But yeah I can train it for a neut ship for the near future.

Yeah looks like I need retards with no friends :). I modified my fit further, it has 3 medium neuts 2 medium nos also with a medium cap booster. It can run 2 nos 2 neut with cap stability without needing the booster. It should cap out most marauder fits (even ones with cap boosters I believe) in 2-3 minutes and keep them capped out with running the stable 2*2. 

I will try capping a marauder out and then pulling my drones out so the marauder cant use smartbombs. Meanwhile the bomber can add to the dps.

Good thing is I can choose the wormhole to stalk so I could choose those people who fit no cap boosters to their marauders. 

Bad thing is the whole plan resides on taking a long time to kill a marauder while no friends of it shows up. It is not a likely scenario

Thank you for your helpful comments.<\s>This proteus fit can cap that marauder out in 2 minutes. After that it can keep him capped out by running 2 neut 2 nos cap stable (without needing the cap booster). The proteus itself has 220k ehp passive tank, 500 dps (or 170k/600dps). At that point all it needs to break is the marauders 90k ehp passive tank with that drone dps (I could also use a bomber alt to help it). It looks doable. I dont believe any marauder can apply its dps to break this proteus tank before the proteus can break its but we will see.

Again, on paper it looks viable but everything is dependent on no additional friends incoming, which is not likely.

Instead if being a whiny bitch, how about you","working with a fearful dog, but these are just some of the techniques I'm using currently with MY dog.

133,33,"in the next month you need 1 million dollars. Instead of accepting the risk, you may want to pay 1 dollar per month, and have someone else taking the risk. That would be the insurance company, which serves a large number of customers and therefore is financially much more stable and can easily cover the expenses of unlucky individuals.

It is important to notice that estimating 1. the probability of these expensive events 2. the expected cost of these events,  is extremely important to decide how much you should pay per month. That's why the insurance companies try to get useful information such as: medical examination / age / habits of the customer for health insurance, car value and driving records for car insurances, etc... Therefore the price that you have to pay may vary from customer to customer.

Finally, notice that the society as a whole may have the interest of making sure that nobody is affected by these unlikely but expensive events, for many reasons: for example, because your failure to pay may affect other innocent people (think about road accidents, but also children of people with major medical conditions); or because the people affected by such events could be a ""cost"" for the society in terms of safety, crime, emergency care; or because the society as a whole believes that nobody should be left behind, at least to some extent. In these cases, the state might act as an insurance provider. In many European countries some decent level of health care is universally provided, and the costs are shared not according to the probability of using these services, but according to the people income and/or wealth.

An interesting fact: some cultures are really risk adverse. In Germany and Switzerland, for example, people are usually insured against any possible event: loss of like, sickness, loss of job, invalidity, fires, theft, legal expenses in litigations. Their house, their furniture (if they rent), their belongings, are insured. Some insurance companies even offer a ""jolly insurance"".

2. [LD50 of alcohol in rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) is in fact about 7 g / kg. I trust you when you say that in humans it could go up to 10 g/kg.

3. The graphic is using LD50 for rats, but with a typo (mg instead of g). The ratio of the two is still correct, and in fact let us say that you need 490g of alcohol or 6.3 liters of water to kill a person. Which means,",reddit_1048489,reddit_1048489,True

Yes, Swift can already do a lot more than print(""Hello World"") :)<\s>Though I’m a little more agnostic on it if you notice that Blurrr supports C, Lua, JavaScript, and Swift, but I’ll go out on a limb and try to answer that. 

- Swift looks like it is a pretty nice language without a lot of hard flaws like we see in some currently popular languages, say JavaScript and C++. (Ever see Gary Bernhardt's WAT talk? https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)

- It seems to have captured a lot of people’s imaginations, in that everybody seems to recognize something from their favorite language in Swift

- Apple is huge right now, so a big chunk of the industry is going to learn Swift for iOS/Mac development (front-end) development.

- IBM and other server backend companies are looking at Swift as a good candidate for their backend problems. The traditional languages all have serious shortcomings in their trade-offs in their complexity vs. performance/power consumption dynamics right now. (Rust and Go seem to be the other serious contenders in this area.)

And this underlies the real reason why Swift may become dominant…people and management. Humans and managers like to standardize on things. The fewer things in their mind the better. I’m not saying this is the best approach, but just stating how the world seems to work. 

We’ve already seen this with the Web and NodeJS. There is a huge (and somewhat successful) push to have JavaScript everywhere, for both the front-end and the back-end. The justification is that engineers only need to learn one language, so it is easier for the hiring process, is easier to manage, and easier to develop.

In practice, I don’t think this has fully lived up. A specific problem to NodeJS is that JavaScript doesn’t really do threads, so async/callback programming must be done. This is actually a really different way to program than everything else, so immediately the skillsets are pretty different even though you are in the same language. Then for large scaling data center situations, JavaScript isn’t the most power efficient language, meaning you need more hardware, electricity, and cooling","s, there is also a little bit of history to try to express the idea of what it was like being a gamer in that era.
So even if you don’t ultimately agree with my opinions, I still believe you will find the presentation interesting and fun.

Edit: Formatting<\s>Yes, you are right that discovery is a big part for me. I also love, for example, the original Zelda and Metroid and you could probably even say Doom for those aspects. I wouldn't say it is only discovery, and it is interesting how discovery interacts completely differently with each of these different types of games. But returning to the notion of challenge, I feel like there is a connection here. In other types of game, we might refer to how the user can master the game mechanics as the core challenge. But an adventure game doesn't really have this in the same way, so we have to rely on our interactions with the puzzles and other various responses in the world. It seems that an element of discovery has to part of this to make it joyful.<\s>Thank you! I appreciate any help in spreading the word. :)<\s>Thank you. This video was also to celebrate classic Sierra games even if you don't ultimately agree with my opinion.<\s>Thank you!<\s>This video was too long already :)

In general, I think we in the adventure game community lack a formal understanding of how these games worked, and instead it works by intuition and looking at prior examples. While good intuition can be a substitute, it also makes it hard to judge whether something is good or bad, but more importantly explain why, if we don't have a theoretical framework we can compare/reason against. And it is hard to pass on knowledge to new/other designers if the best designers only worked on their intuition.

This video was an attempt to try to formalize some ideas so we have a way of communicating them to each other better.

I do try to focus on the positives, because the discussion for adventure games for the past 20 years has been dominated by the negatives, and it really hasn't gotten us anywhere. We get it. Certain puzzles really sucked. But that didn't give us any actionable things we could use to improve the genre. Instead, it seems the two things we got were to remove puzzles entirely or completely abandon",reddit_1031755,reddit_1031755,True

There's several reasons to use captchas, although, like you said they're no longer viable to prevent botting, they're still useful to prevent unwanted actions, like a missclick. They may also be used as a form of confirmation. Or as a way to prevent mass request by spamming the event button. Also, capctchas actually help by using them to decipher certain words or phrases. Ever saw one of those capcthas that looked like a photo and you had no idea of what was written in it? it was most likely part of a program to try and decipher the word by using the input of countless people, so as you see captchas also help society in uncovering history :D

Back to bot prevention.... Yes, numerical or shape captchas no longer work, but others do. Like the ones to give context about a picture, or to analyze an environment to look for the odd one out. Image analyzes isn't ""cheap"" or reliable, and those forms of captchas can be used to secure information ( a good example of this is the reCAPTCHA from google)

But your conclusion seems to be quite the opposite of what's going on (in *my* opinion, of course ;) )

Braavos strongly opposes against slavery, so Daenerys absolutely conforms to their long term goals. She is the Breaker of Chains. She *frees* slaves. Meaning the IB decided not to kill, but to *finance* her. Not spontaneously, of course. They watched her and her brother for months while they stayed at Illyrios house. It took us five seconds to figure out that Viserys was a cunt, so Illyrio must have noticed that, too. But even if not: Remember the dialogue between Jorah and Viserys? The Cart King asked him how it came that he lost his honor. Jorah explained that he had sold some poachers into slavery. Viserys then gave him a promise that nobody would be ""punished for such nonsense"" in his kingdom. He also treated all the slaves and servants like shit. Meaning he did not intend to give up on slavery, or maybe he would even enslave the smallfolk in Westeros. 
Jorah spied for Varys, not only on Dany, but on Viserys, too - so he for sure had reported this relevant information about the wrong horse the IB was about to place their bets on. That's why the IB decided to support Dany instead of Viserys.

Remember when Varys and Illyrio met in the cellars? They were talking about a war that might come too soon and how they'd need more time. Arya misunderstood them, when they were talking about Jon Arryns death and how another Hand might die, too. She concluded that they were the bad guys, but since we know that Littlefinger and Lysa Arryn killed Jon, we know that they were just concerned. Varys was at the Small Council meeting when Ned complained about wasting sums they couldn't afford on a win bonus in the Hand's tourney, so Varys knew that he was different, a good man, truly concerned about the realm.

Illyrio indirectly said that he was preparing an army to invade Westeros to chase Robert Baratheon, the Usurper,","just stopping, which is straight up inconsiderate.

As you can imagine, school is miserable for both kids and teachers when the kids are hungry, sick or cold, and the kids are badly-behaved to top it off.

Then, there are the schools with amazing parental support. The kids are well-behaved and well-taken care of at home so the teacher's only job is to teach them (as it should be, teachers are not nurses or social workers). The parents also support the kids' learning at home by reading to them or helping with homework (like they should, your kid's education is not just your teacher's job, it is also your responsibility as a parent).

148,48,"some examples of abilities he would have and what CR the party is?<\s>Think of it as a class that has very little actual spellcasting, 3/4 BAB, and a bunch of spell-like abilities - all of which use 'power points' (mental focus) to fuel.

For each Implement you have, you get a base power, a resonant power, and a spell known of each level from that school.

You then gain extra 'Spell-likes' in the form of focus powers.

The 'power points' (Mental Focus) gets assigned to each implement you have at the start of the day, which depletes as you use your 'Spell-Like' abilities (as an aside, your Resonant Power is based off of the initial allotment of Mental Focus).

You can spontaneously cast spells.

As a class, its definitely a gish. Based on the Implements you choose to have, it can be built to fill most any role you want - Its a lot like a Factotum if you ever played 3.5

I can try to answer any other questions you have.<\s>looks like you would want any type of caster then, since you can just reflavor the abilities how you want<\s>Implements, focus powers, and spells known never change. All that changes at the beginning of the day is how you allot your Mental Focus.

The spells you know are set in stone - For each implement you have, you learn 1 spell for each spell level you cast, when you level up and can cast a new 'level' of spell, you gain 1 spell know for each implement you own.


Example would be 

I am a level 4 Occultist and have 2 implements: Div and Trans. Every morning I divide my Pool of Mental Focus between these 2 implements, to use the focus powers I chose.

I know 2 level 0 spells (1 div, 1 trans), 2 level 1 spells (1 div and 1 trans), and 2 level 2 spells (1 div, and 1 trans). 

When I gain a new implement at level 6 and chose Evoc, I would add 1 Evo spell of each spell level to spell knows. I would then be allowed to split my mental focus between the 3 implements every morning how I saw fit.<\s>I mean, its HiPS, its from 3/3","that are difficult to answer with certainty.

While I believe that the United States has a serious race problem, Ryan seems to be racializing a matter that is not innately racist (at least, no more-so than any other skilled activity that requires resources).  In all his accusations of racism throughout the episode, I didn't hear him recommend a change to the institution to make it less racist.  Indeed, most of his criticism seemed to be applicable to any skilled activity where a participant could benefit from practice and coaching.  I may be misunderstanding but he seemed to be attacking debate for not first solving the social problem of American racial disenfranchisement before discussing other topics.

In my view, this is at once intellectually bankrupt and self-destructive.  If those who are disadvantaged refuse the opportunity to constructively participate in other societal matters until the issue of inequality is solved, they stop the best engine of social progress.  This isn't to say they need to ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps;"" civil disobedience is often a legitimate means to achieve a particular goal.  But what was the goal here?  Instead, Ryan seemed to be berating a group of people for not solving hundreds of years of injustice.  This seems hardly compelling.

The essence of enfranchisement is to participate in addressing problems that affect society at large.  If you cannot address matters other than your own plight, you become the agent of your own destruction.

First, they'll ask for a tracking number. I said I bought something from HTC and they are having issues sending shipping confirmation emails to orders in Japan. They asked for the name and address it should be shipping to. I supplied that... (you might want to open your original HTC invoice for preorder and copy paste the shipping info if you still have access to that)

The agent gave me a tracking number (Should arrive by 6pm tonight!)

I asked for permission to send you guys there and the agent said: ""sure, but we still suggest you can confirm with shipper first to get the tracking number."" I said that HTC has been slow responding to support, and he said it was fine to contact FedEx in that case.

""Lyarra. A beautiful name."" Jon smiled. He had not talked to many women since his wife passed. He was afraid to fall in love again. 

""What brings you to Winterfell?""<\s>Jon's head snapped around to the elder sister. She was absolutely beautiful, but the words came out like fire. Jon didn't know whether to respond in the same attitude, or let it go. He decided on the latter. 

""My lady, I apologize if I have offended you. Please forgive me, I am new to the ways of lordship. I came here after my lord father passed, to swear my oaths to the Lord of Winterfell. Mierin, is that right? You both have beautiful names. Mine is rather... overused.""

Something about the two women intrigued him. They were polar opposites, but both had their attractiveness. The little one wasn't necessarily beautiful, but her timidness was appealing. Mierin was fierce, but stunning.<\s>Jon grinned. Two women were kind.

""You speak truly, my lady. And I am impressed by your history."" He smiled, impressed by the lady's knowledge. He himself was a history aficionado. ""I, myself, have ancestors important to the night's watch. His name was Rodrik Flint, and he was perhaps the worst Lord Commander to ever wear the cloak.

""You're a trustworthy man, I saw it in you when you talked about your family."" 

Jon smiled.

""Bear with me, my lord. I know you expected to come in here to a debate. Let me ask you a hypothetical question: What happens if Rickard ends the council right now, and we are forced to choose? We are not united.. not yet at least.""<\s>Jon smiled.

""Have you come here to persuade me, my lord?"" 

Jon swirled the ale in his mug.

""Why that's entirely unnecessary. I must admit, it was my goal to extend the council as long as I could, to give Rodrik ample time to return. I needed to create as much of a divide as possible- to alienate the dissidents as best I could. But, I'm afraid time is running short. The council is coming to an end and Rodrik is no where to be found. We need another plan.""

Hope this helps :)<\s>I couldn't get on with Manic Panic to begin with and found Stargazer the best semi-dye for my hair.

I appreciate the concern :)<\s>This is gorgeous and I'm jealous. Nice ink :)<\s>I'd go to a professional hair stylist. You could really damage your hair, even if you're trying to be careful. I would tell them that you're going to be dying it blue after and that you just want it lightened enough for a semi permanent dye. 

This way you ensure your hair is safe and as healthy as it can be with bleach. I know some people don't like to spend the money but your hair is really important and once it's damaged it's hard to get the condition back. I've had bright/unnatural semi dye hair for 5 years and I still to this day get my roots done at the salon. Better safe than sorry!

As for the semi-permanent dye, i have a few tips to get bright/long lasting dye. Firstly, if Artic Fox is anything like Manic Panic, Stargazer etc, which I believe it is, you can leave the dye on for as long as you want. I find that an hour gets great colour. It normally says 20 minutes on the box, but leaving it on longer doesn't cause any harm because it's a vegetable based dye without any harmful chemicals that can damage your hair :) Secondly, try to wash your hair as little as possible (once a week is ideal).

Since it doesn't look like you have an internship, your post grad work experience will be an important factor in you getting an interview, maybe just as important than exams.

AfaIk, both Falskar &amp; Wirmstooth shouldn't be a problem since they don't touch the vampires, so my bet would be 3DNPC interacting somehow with Requiem/Dawnguard.  
Try checking with TES4Edit which mod is interacting with/affecting vampire lords, and that should give you a starting point.

There was also one of the best armor mod I've ever seen so far, even today, wonderful, outstanding, dark-themed armors but sadly I don't remember the name right now...   

Last, but not least, take a look at [","but with this last game I intended to roleplay for the first time, so even when I'm playing in HA-2H, I'm rarely close to that cap. I'm not sure if your total cw counts towards the speed, but if so this could be the reason; to put it on numbers, let's say:  

* Playing light armor, carry weight 85 out of 90 (starting with a breton, looting every spoon)  
* Playing heavy armor, carry weight 90 out of 120 (starting with a nord, looting just what I'm using plus REALLY profitable items)  

In this game, I don't use to loot iron/leather items at all, mostly elven if I found them or just the light pieces of heavy armor, aka helmet/gauntlets/boots; orcish armor's value is very attractive, but it weights too much and most of the time you can just loot a few gems with even higher value, and ot top of that, as said, I'm trying to roleplay as much as possible, so I'm not looting dead bodies unless they are bosses/etc...  

Out of this, as said, I didn't really found it anoying even on early levels; you just need to rest after battles and pay attention to the enviroment ""just in case"", and once you can take/buy/cook some food, (I think it's possible to get some food in Helgen's dungeon, not sure, but absolutly yes once you reach Riverwood) you're good to go.<\s>&gt; or differ depending on weapon types. Like daggers having 20% and maces having 50%. So that weapon types would still matter in some amount even with Daedric wepons.  

I think this is the best balance option; that way, blades for example could get +35% which is a very good bonus, but not so OP (thinking of Dawnbreaker), and maces could get the full 100% with perks. I think 20% daggers, 35% blades/axes &amp; 50% maces to be the perfect balance.  

Honestly, I've never used dragonbone items playing Requiem; the 50% AP is just too good to try another thing, so the truth is I don't have anything to compare, but I'd say daedric weapons are much better than dragonbone",reddit_1025280,reddit_1025280,True

From what I observe, a lot of us who enjoyed the book care deeply about canon and the original characters. I certainly don't care for overused tropes or want to be ""pandered to"". In fact there's a bunch of threads making fun of the book, responded to by people who join in the fun while saying they still enjoyed reading it. We're just able and willing to treat this book as a funny spin-off to the original HP series.

No homo!' without evoking any real emotions from the reader. Now with Scorpius and Albus, I genuinely felt that it had the potential of a romantic relationship, and was disappointed with that no homo tack at the back. But that's not my biggest gripe. I'd just have been happy for it to end without Scorpius asking Rose out at the end.

She went through a bout of not eating and losing a lot of weight - x-rays, ultrasounds,  a ct, multi day er stays.  I have bills for this cat totalling over 20 grand and i've only ended up paying about 3 grand out of pocket.

I pa $54 a month for both cats and them covering Nimbus's medication that she will be on for life covers her half of the premium.

I work with people-health and people-life insurance and after extensive research healthy paws seemed to be the best choice for me and my pets and I couldn't be happier.  Pet insurance is regulated in the US like property insurance - like if i wanted to insure my wife's jewelry.

Many people here are bitching that pet insurance is a waste and in many cases yes it is.  But it also provides Peace of Mind which can be invaluable.

The gain on the mic is turned completely down, and from there is all post-processing.

I tend to use Audition's dynamics processing to attempt to equalize everything to around -6 dB, but that would take a bit of time to build a preset that matches your commentary. I *think* Audacity has something that does the same basic thing.

Once the recorded audio is boosted through the dynamics processing or generic amplifying, I usually increase the bass by 3 to 6 dB in Premiere to help hide the echo. I haven't gotten any feedback on how it sounds with the higher bass, so it might be too much, but I think/hope it's okay.

My advice would be to record at the lowest gain possible with the mic close to you and just turn it up in post, adding effects to reduce echo as much as possible.<\s>Outside of maybe a few revenue issues, I don't think there should be any problems.

182,82,"make it your GOAL to hit your goal. Your goal shouldn't be ""eat under 1000"", it should be ""eat within 50-100 calories of 1000"". Whether you're 50 over or 50 under doesn't matter.. just stay within a range of your goal.

Meal prepping can be really helpful, but it's definitely not necessary. I tend to plan my meals the day before and then if I have to, cook the day or two before, but otherwise I cook them day of. I enjoy cooking, it takes up some time from my day so I don't spend that time snacking and the more you cook the better and more effecient at it you become!

Buy and prepackage your own snacks in ziploc or tupperware containers. This way if you're under your calorie goal, you have quick things to eat and you know how many calories they are. Have fruits ready to snack on, or small amounts of lunch meats. You want to have something to fall back on if you are really hungry but didn't have a meal prepared.

If you tend to forget to eat (I do this at work/school a lot) then set some alarms for when you generally have ""time"". There is usually a 30min chunk during the day that you have time to do something, but people can tend to forget about it, or think ""oh I'll get to it later"" and then they miss out on that chunk. Set an alarm and if you're not 100% incapable of leaving what you're doing at the moment; go eat.<\s>The best ways to reduce overeating is to make the food less accessible or make easy swaps.

* Take smaller portions at meal times and drink an entire glass of water before deciding if you want seconds. Use a smaller plate if possible to help control portions.
* Don't bring containers of chips/salsa/guac/whatever snack to the TV/Bedroom with you, take just one serving and leave.
* If you're overeating because you feel hungry, eat more protein and less carbs. Proteins and fats will generally make you feel fuller longer. Protein being fewer calories than fats.
* Plan your meals/calories and leave room for snacks and stuff so you can still eat frequently but won't be eating too many calories.
* Get rid of things you tend to overeat on if possible.

1) &lt;Gambler&gt; throws out cards in a static pattern (think Twisted Fate in LoL). Higher ranks of the ability throw out more cards (maybe 1/3/3/5), and each one has one of the four primary elements randomly attached to it with a 100% proc chance. The main card that flies where you aimed will always be predetermined by energy colour (like Chroma's skills) to lessen the RNG-ness a bit.

2) Activate to start a roulette of results in the bottom left corner, press again to stop. (Perhaps killing enemies while it's active can slow down the roulette.) You get a buff dependent on which ""number"" you land on (maybe around three or four results). Some examples could be giving your teammates more weapon damage for X seconds, or having enemies shooting at you becoming less accurate.

3) Enemies within a close range are very briefly stunned, while &lt;Gambler&gt; goes through their belongings and reapplies some of their tech. Temporarily steals a percentage of armour from grineer, shields from corpus, and health from infested. (Corrupted could be a mixed bag depending on the original factions of the enemies affected.)

If you want someone to fall for your scam, you need to make sure they think they are taking advantage of something or someone, possibly you. It's not just that they offer $200 as a refund. They offer a refund that you are not entitled to have. That is the key point. When they do that, people lower their defenses, and they are not willing to look for help.<\s>I'll give you something else to think about then :)

When you make a life choice (""eat less trans fat"") that lower the probability of some death cause (""disease of the circulatory system"") you are basically increasing the probability of other causes, because you will eventually die.

For example, there was a [specific sign](http://www.interactivetraining.co.uk/proofreading-symbols.html) to note on the margin in case one or more character was upside down.<\s>This is like people asking why you wear a helmet while climbing.

Several horrendous medical experiments have been performed in Nazi concentration camps, and the vast majority of them was completely useless for the advance of medical science (not that any use would have justified them).

However, some experiments on hypothermia and the resistance of human body to low temperatures have somehow facilitated the design of medical procedures that are still in use today.

3 Doors Down - Love Is A Lie Lyrics:

(YouTube Channel - MLG - Music Lyrics Genesis - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIhq65AWS3GS4fmRsvxq7wQ)

Said you wanted to feel beautiful
And did I ever tell you differently?
I tried to give you all that you deserved
And never mind the things you said to me
Along the way I didn't say all the things I felt inside myself
You took away all that I thought was mine
And then you gave it all to someone else

You said you only wanted love
The love wasn't enough
And soon enough you said goodbye
Goodbye
How weary am I to be?
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie

Everybody told me I was crazy
But you told me to believe your lies
Guess I was sober, but now your love might save me
But I think I died a thousand times
I never knew this side of you
The side that I wish I had never seen
Soon enough I guess I would discover I had a lover could be so mean

You said you only wanted love
The love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
Goodbye
How weary am I to be?
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie
[x2]

Said you wanted to feel beautiful
And","protein so you can make a meal out of them. I suggest adding onions to your rice and beans because they make everything taste better. Rice and beans both need to be boiled in water and it's really easy, just look it up on Google. Dry beans need to be soaked in water first though. I'd add the onions, butter, and some salt and pepper to your rice and beans. (Cook separately, add rice and beans, cook a little more). It should taste fine and be good for you. You'll get used to how much of these to use, it's not something you need to be really accurate measuring every time. 

And since I also mentioned potatoes I might as well add the lunch idea which is a microwaved potato with salt, pepper, and butter. On the side you can have a hard boiled egg. If you don't like the texture then cook it with a soft yolk. Again, ask Google if you don't know how, it will have pictures and videos. 

And since you asked about adding vegetables to your diet as well you could just pick up some frozen mixed vegetables and add them as a side dish. Again, add butter, salt, and pepper. Seriously, they can make anything taste good. Maybe you'll get adventurous and use sweet potatoes sometimes too. They're still good with salt, pepper, and butter, but they're also good with butter and honey.

Finally, snacks. Peanut butter is good with a lot of fruits and easy to just spoon on or dip into. Have bananas and apples with peanut butter for snacks. If you have enough money you can get mixed nuts for snacks as well, they're full of energy and have lots of the nutrients you need to be healthy. 

Just pick what's easiest/cheapest for you. There are some good comments here and Google is your friend, it will tell you the fastest way to cook anything.<\s>Glad I could help.<\s>The way you phrased the first part is a little odd considering the rest of your statement. It's certainly acceptable for women to find short men unattractive, it's just not okay for them to be rude about it. As a feminist I think you can like and be attracted to whomever the fuck you want, but if someone asks you out and you think they're too fat or to short you don't say that to them, you tell them you're not interested because it's basic human decency.<\s",reddit_1020396,reddit_1051041,False

I'll broadstroke my opinion: I saw what I wanted to see (aka RUSEV AND CESARO...TWICE)  
  
During one of the earlier commercial breaks, AJ Styles came out and called out John Cena for a quick beatdown. AJ teased the clash, but John reversed it into an Attitude Adjustment and then tossed some merch to the audience.  
  
Dark match was Randy Orton vs. Bray Wyatt. Solid match that really helped give more wrestling weight to an otherwise Promo heavy show. RKO was teased twice, as was Abigail, which was reversed into a legitimate RKO (to an EXPLOSIVE cheer) for the pin. Randy took a good chunk of time to give the fans some love, he looked very happy and the fans absolutely LOVED him.  
  
Roman Reigns was a huge highlight. The crowd booed during his initial entrance, but the wine glass and cake spot earned him some legitimate cheers. His spear to Rusev got a short boo, but his exit was marked by cheers. Not sure if the cameras were off, but he popped back out onto the ramp and did a little showboating and people liked it. He seemed sad about the early boos, but towards the end he looked like he was having fun. I think Roman Reigns deserves another try along with his new gleeful persona, but that's just me.  
  
Goldust not wrestling was a big disappointment (I watched him wrestle at a House show in San Bernadino when I was 3 years old), but the fact that his screentime was paired with a random Scooby Doo promo was even worse. Legitimate shot to my childhood :\",reddit_1012012,reddit_1012012,True
